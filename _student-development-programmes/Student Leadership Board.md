<p>The Student Leadership Board (SLB) serves as the voice of the student
body, advocating for positive changes that enhance school culture, foster
a strong sense of school spirit, and raise pride in our school. SLB members
also embody servant leadership and scholarly values, grounded in the school's
core values of <strong>G.R.A.C.E.</strong>
</p>
<p>All student leaders undergo a comprehensive leadership development program,
equipping them with the five exemplary leadership practices <strong>(M.I.C.E.E</strong>).
They apply these skills through a range of initiatives that contribute
to school life, such as:</p>
