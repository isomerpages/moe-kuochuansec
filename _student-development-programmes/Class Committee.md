**CLASS LEADERSHIP STRUCTURE**
	
</center>	

**<u>Background</u>**

As part of enhancing teaching processes through ensuring a positive classroom culture and being in line with the school’s distinctive LLP (CYL) programme, the class leadership structure is reviewed as part of promoting everyday leadership and allowing platforms for ownership of class-specific events.

**<u>Objectives</u>**

The Class Leadership Development provides platforms for:

1.     **Everyday leadership** opportunities in KCPSS,

2.     Enhancing Peer Support and Relationship efforts (**PSR**),

3.     Students to have **ownership and voice** in the day to day class activities for bonding, building class culture and ensuring student well-being.

**<u>Growing the Class Peer Leader as an everyday KCPian Servant Leader</u>**

Class Peer Leaders will support 2 major functions namely in the areas of:

1.     Influencing others positively and working towards a positive class culture

2.     Strengthening peer support within class

In an academic year, the Class Peer Leaders attend various Training and Equipping sessions as part of effective servant leadership. With this equipping process, we hope to provide opportunities for them to develop leadership skills and competencies, effectively leading themselves and others.

Class leaders are exposed to various opportunities and experiences. For example, they spearhead the Class Bee-Longing Project to build class spirit and peer support within class. They also work closely with the class in key signature programmes like the school’s annual Youth Day Celebrations.
