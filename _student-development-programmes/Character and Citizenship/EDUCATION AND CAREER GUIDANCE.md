### Teachers

Our ECG Counsellor is stationed at the school once a week to provide support to students (individually or in small groups) to help them make informed decisions on post-secondary education and career options.  

  

Students who would like to explore more about subject choices, inquire about post-secondary education options or find out more about their career interests, strengths and passions, can have a chat with our school’s ECG Counsellor.
