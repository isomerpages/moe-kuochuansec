<p><strong>2. Learning journey to Polytechnic Open House in January</strong>
</p>
<p>Graduating students will have the opportunity to visit the polytechnics
during the January open house to experience polytechnic life as well have
an understanding of the various courses offered. Through this visit, it
is hoped that students will be able to make informed decisions with regards
to their post secondary education choices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;
<br><strong>3. Applied Studies Experience (ASE) @ Ngee Ann Polytechnic</strong>
</p>
<p>As part of enhanced Education and Career Guidance (ECG) efforts to support
students in making considered decisions about their education and career
plans and take positive steps to embark on them, interested students will
be given the opportunity to attend the ASE at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.</p>
<p>The Applied Studies Experience” allows students to explore and pursue
their interests through engaging course activities and authentic hands-on
experiences.</p>
