<p><strong>“Let your light shine”</strong> is aligned to our school’s vision
“We are to be a School on a Hill, shining a light for all”. Aside from
benefitting recipients of the VIA activities, student volunteers who let
their light shine through such activities, can also inspire the rest to
serve and do good for the community.
<br>
<br>The switch located within the phrase <strong>“Let your light shine”</strong> symbolically
represents the students’ choice to make a difference to other peoples’
lives. The spotlight in the background represents the collective light
from the students’ effort in shining their light and brightening up the
lives of the beneficiaries, one community at a time.The types of effort
include playing games with the beneficiaries and creating awareness posters
advocating the improvement of the quality of living of the beneficiaries.
This is highlighted through photos taken with the beneficiaries below.

<p>Lastly, the sunny smiley faces represent the extent to which the impact
we hope to make on the beneficiaries each time they recall their experience
with KCPians.</p>
