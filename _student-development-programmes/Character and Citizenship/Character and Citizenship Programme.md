<p><strong>2. Value-in-Action</strong>
</p>
<p>In KCPSS, the VIA curriculum and approach is centred on the theme “Let
your light shine! Developing a Service Heart IN Everyone!”. In aligning
to our school’s vision “We are to be a School on a Hill, shining a light
for all”, VIA is a key CCE student development experience that builds e21CC
in particular, civic literacy and, hones collaborative and communicative
skills. The imagery of a shining light powerfully captures the goal of
enriching the lives of the beneficiaries and empowering VIA representatives
and student leaders to inspire fellow KCPians to serve and do good for
the community.</p>
<p>All cohort VIA projects follow the AAA Model of Action, Awareness and
Advocacy. Our KCPians will take Action to improve a situation they care
about, promote Awareness so that others may learn about an important concern
in the community, and be an Advocate by inspiring and influencing others
to make a difference to something they care about.</p>

<p>Gifts from the Heart (GFTH) is a signature VIA programme. It provides
an opportunity for KCPians to develop a heart of empathy and demonstrate
agape love to the less privileged in the community. Held over the Lunar
New Year period, GFTH sends a heartwarming message to the beneficiaries
that in a festive season, that they are not forgotten.
