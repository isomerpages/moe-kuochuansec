## Area of Focus

Cyber Wellness (CW) refers to the positive well-being of Internet users. It involves an understanding of online behaviour and awareness of how to protect oneself in cyberspace. 

KCPSS have adopted MOE Cyberwellness framework to guide us in school wide CW Education.

The three principles, **‘Respect for Self and Others’, ‘Safe and Responsible Use’** and **‘Positive Peer Influence’** when adhered to will anchor a child’s well-being in cyberspace as he will then be able to make careful and well-considered decisions. 

The framework also features a 3-step process to explore Cyber issues:   

The **Sense – Think – Act Process**

1. **Sense**: Identify the possible risks of harmful behaviours online and learn how to protect oneself

2. **Think**: Analyse, evaluate and reflect on the online situation based on the three CW principles

3. **Act**: Translate understanding into actions so as to be safe and have a positive presence online
