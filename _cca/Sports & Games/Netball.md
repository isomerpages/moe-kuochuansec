<p>The Netball CCA aims to help aspiring young student athletes, with or
without prior netball training experience, to learn the rules and strategies
of the game. We also aim to develop their fitness and strength such that
they are able to stay competitive at the Zonals and Nationals levels of
the National School Games. Despite the focus in striving for success, we

moral values in our students.</p>
