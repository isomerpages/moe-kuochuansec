The Netball CCA aims to help aspiring young student athletes, with or without prior netball training experience, to learn the rules and strategies of the game. We also aim to develop their fitness and strength such that they are able to stay competitive at the Zonals and Nationals levels of the National School Games. Despite the focus in striving for success, we also place a  strong emphasis on developing sportsmanship and strong moral values in our students.
