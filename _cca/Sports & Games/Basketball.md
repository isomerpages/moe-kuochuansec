### Vision

Everything negative - pressure, challenges - is all an opportunity for me to rise. Kobe Bryant, Basketball Player KCPSS Basketball CCA aims to develop and nurture our basketball players to be <b>athletes of G.R.A.C.E</b> who are <b>passionate</b> about the game.  Every basketball player has their own unique set of skills and we want to help them be the best version of themselves. Basketball as a game and sport can be easily picked up, but transforming into a skillful player takes commitment and discipline. Having the right mindset and attitude is therefore important to set the foundation for growth. Our basketball sessions involve the training of both the physical and mental states. We aim to grow our students not just in sportsmanship but also in character. We seek to groom <b>committed</b> and <b>respectful</b> sportsmen who display <b>discipline</b> and <b>perseverance</b> in the face of all challenges.

### Area of Focus

KCPSS Basketball CCA believes that CCA plays an important role in the physical, character and leadership development of the students.

  

Every year, the basketball team will represent the school in the South Zone Basketball Championships and the ActiveSG Basketball Development League. In preparation for the competitions, our basketball players go through physically demanding and challenging court and physical training sessions. 

  

Under the dedicated guidance of the coach and teachers-in-charge, our basketball players challenge and strive to develop themselves both physically and mentally. Valuable teachable moments during trainings and competitions provide learning opportunities for character and values development.

  

In leadership development, our basketball players are also given leadership opportunities to take ownership of their development in the CCA. Basketball players are given the autonomy to plan for physical training sessions and bonding activities within the CCA and to inspire the team in creating a shared vision.
