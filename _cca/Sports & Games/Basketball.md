<h3>Vision</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width:45%;margin-right:15px;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/The%20Kuo%20Chuan%20Experience/CCA/Basketball/vision%20photo%20(new).jpeg">

<p>KCPSS Basketball CCA aims to develop and nurture our basketball players
to be <strong>athletes of G.R.A.C.E</strong> who are <strong>passionate</strong> about
the game. Every basketball player has their own unique set of skills and
we want to help them to be the best version of themselves.</p>
<p>Basketball as a game and sport can be easily picked up, but transforming
oneself into a skillful player takes commitment and discipline. Having
the right mindset and attitude is therefore important to set the foundation
for growth.</p>
<p>Our basketball sessions involve the training of both the physical and
mental states. We aim to grow our students not just in sportsmanship but
also in character. We seek to groom <strong>committed</strong> and <strong>respectful</strong> sportsmen
who display <strong>discipline</strong> and <strong>perseverance</strong> in
the face of all challenges.</p>

<h3>Area of Focus</h3>

<p>We believe that CCA plays an important role in the physical, character
and leadership development of the students. Every year, TEAM KCP Basketball
team will represent the school in the South Zone Basketball Championship.
In preparation for the competitions, our basketball players go through
physically demanding and challenging court and physical training sessions.
Under the dedicated guidance of the coach and teachers-in-charge, our basketball
players challenge and strive to develop themselves both physically and
mentally. Valuable teachable moments during trainings and competitions
provide learning opportunities for character and values development. In
leadership development, our basketball players are also given leadership
opportunities to take ownership of their development in the CCA. Basketball
players are given the autonomy to plan for physical training sessions and
bonding activities within the CCA and to inspire the team in creating a
shared vision.</p>
