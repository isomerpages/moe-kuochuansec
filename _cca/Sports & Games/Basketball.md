### Vision

Everything negative - pressure, challenges - is all an opportunity for me to rise. Kobe Bryant, Basketball Player KCPSS Basketball CCA aims to develop and nurture our basketball players to be <b>athletes of G.R.A.C.E</b> who are <b>passionate</b> about the game.  Every basketball player has their own unique set of skills and we want to help them be the best version of themselves. Basketball as a game and sport can be easily picked up, but transforming into a skillful player takes commitment and discipline. Having the right mindset and attitude is therefore important to set the foundation for growth. Our basketball sessions involve the training of both the physical and mental states. We aim to grow our students not just in sportsmanship but also in character. We seek to groom <b>committed</b> and <b>respectful</b> sportsmen who display <b>discipline</b> and <b>perseverance</b> in the face of all challenges.
