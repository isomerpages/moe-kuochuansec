### Vision

<img align="left" style="width:35%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/The%20Kuo%20Chuan%20Experience/CCA/Table%20Tennis/table-tennis1.jpg">

The CCA starts with the objective of teaching interested students to understand and apply the rules of Table Tennis. The CCA allows the students (ranging from beginners to advanced players) to learn and apply skills such as service, footwork, forehand and backhand shots.  
  
The game itself will teach students to learn about sportsmanship and the value of fair play. Being in the teams promotes teamwork and discipline, which are beneficial to the students.

### Area of Focus

The regular training and competitions will help students acquire Table Tennis knowledge, strategies and hone their skills. These skills will become essential when they take part in the school’s internal competitions and subsequently the South Zone and even National Inter-school table tennis competitions. The emphasis on skills and the necessary confidence will help the students to eventually apply what they have learned in the CCA to their daily lives.

**<u>Special Programmes</u>**

The CCA will organise a Day Camp in the June holidays. It will involve enrichment programmes which include group games and challenges to enhance students’ confidence and teamwork.

  

Friendly games against other school teams will help to gauge the students’ readiness for the Inter Schools Competitions.

  

The End of Year intensive training will prepare the students for the Inter Schools Competition in the beginning of the next year. The coaches will assess the basic skills that the students have acquired within the year, and organise an internal competition, and reward the winners with prizes and encourage those who fall behind to close the gap. This competitive atmosphere will help them immensely.
