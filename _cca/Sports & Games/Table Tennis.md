## Table Tennis

### Vision

<img align="left" style="width:35%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/The%20Kuo%20Chuan%20Experience/CCA/Table%20Tennis/table-tennis1.jpg">

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">The CCA starts with the objective of teaching interested students to understand and apply the rules of Table Tennis. The CCA allows the students (ranging from beginners to advanced players) to learn and apply skills such as service, footwork, forehand and backhand shots.</p>  
  
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">The game itself will teach students to learn about sportsmanship and the value of fair play. Being in the teams promotes teamwork and discipline, which are beneficial to the students.</p>

### Mission

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">Kuo Chuan Table Tennis takes on a holistic approach in developing every student in their talent for Table Tennis as well as in their character by equipping them with skills and values that will help them face the challenges of the 21st century. We believe that through discipline and the right approach, students can look forward to a holistic training programme that not only hones their skills and techniques to be highly competent players of the sport, but also develops their leadership potential to be effective Servant Leaders who can inspire a common vision for their peers.</p>


### Area of Focus

<img align="left" style="width:35%;margin-right:15px;" src="/images/The%20Kuo%20Chuan%20Experience/CCA/Table%20Tennis/table-tennis2.jpg">

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">Kuo Chuan Table Tennis aims to equip aspiring young athletes, with or without prior experience, <b>to develop the skills<b> of the sport, such as service, footwork, forehand and backhand shots.  Students will acquire the skills to <b>perform in competitions</b> and stay abreast with the standard required for the school’s internal competitions and subsequently the South Zone and even National Inter-school table tennis competitions. The confidence they develop through the broad exposure will help the students to eventually apply what they have learned in the CCA to their daily lives.<br><br>
Despite the focus on sporting excellence, we also place strong emphasis on ensuring that our student performers are <b>equipped with gracefulness and strong moral values,</b> and are able to manage their academic commitments.

**<u>Special Programmes</u>**

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">The CCA will organise a Day Camp in the June holidays. It will involve enrichment programmes which include group games and challenges to enhance students’ confidence and teamwork.<br><br>
Friendly games against other school teams will help to gauge the students’ readiness for the Inter Schools Competitions.<br><br>
The End of Year intensive training will prepare the students for the Inter Schools Competition in the beginning of the next year. The coaches will assess the basic skills that the students have acquired within the year, and organise an internal competition, and reward the winners with prizes and encourage those who fall behind to close the gap. This competitive atmosphere will help them immensely.</p>
