<h3>Vision</h3>

<p>The CCA starts with the objective of teaching interested students to understand
and apply the rules of Table Tennis. The CCA allows the students (ranging
from beginners to advanced players) to learn and apply skills such as service,
footwork, forehand and backhand shots.</p>
<p>The game itself will teach students to learn about sportsmanship and the
value of fair play. Being in the teams promotes teamwork and discipline,
which are beneficial to the students.</p>
<h3>Mission</h3>
<p>Kuo Chuan Table Tennis takes on a holistic approach in developing every
student in their talent for Table Tennis as well as in their character
by equipping them with skills and values that will help them face the challenges
of the 21st century. We believe that through discipline and the right approach,
students can look forward to a holistic training programme that not only
hones their skills and techniques to be highly competent players of the
sport, but also develops their leadership potential to be effective Servant
Leaders who can inspire a common vision for their peers.</p>
<h3>Area of Focus</h3>

<p>Kuo Chuan Table Tennis aims to equip aspiring young athletes, with or
without prior experience, <strong>to develop the skills</strong> of the sport,
such as service, footwork, forehand and backhand shots. Students will acquire
the skills to <strong>perform in competitions</strong> and stay abreast with
the standard required for the school’s internal competitions and subsequently
the South Zone and even National Inter-school table tennis competitions.
The confidence they develop through the broad exposure will help the students
to eventually apply what they have learned in the CCA to their daily lives.
<br>
<br>Despite the focus on sporting excellence, we also place strong emphasis
on ensuring that our student performers are <strong>equipped with gracefulness and strong moral values,</strong> and
are able to manage their academic commitments.</p>
