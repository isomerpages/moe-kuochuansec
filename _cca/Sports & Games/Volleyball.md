Our players will:

*   Learn the importance of good sportsmanship, teamwork, and communication where they can apply these life skills in their own lives
*   Be inspired to give their best at all times. Work hard during preparation and not leave regrets. Adopt a positive winning attitude. Winning with grace and losing with honour.
