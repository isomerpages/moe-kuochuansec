### Vision

The vision for **KCPSS Football CCA** is to inculcate values such as teamwork, resilience as well as good sportsmanship in all our students. The teachers-in-charge, together with our coaches, aim to create a respectful, positive and healthy environment for our students to improve their individual technical skills and conditioning as well as their understanding and appreciation of team play.

### Area of Focus

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">Every player, coach and teacher in KCPSS knows that Football is a highly physical game that requires great mental strength, strong physique and clever wits. Not only that, it requires a great amount of team work that only through <b>good relationships with team mates</b> will it be accomplished. </p>

  

Last but certainly not the least, Football requires **discipline in character** that makes him a Holistic player whom people hold with high regards. It is in these principles that the **KCPSS Football Team** is built on - every player to graduate from KCPSS with the knowledge of Football, the health and physique of a true athlete, relationships with team mates that lasts and character that brings every player through life.
