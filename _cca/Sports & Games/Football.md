<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">The vision for&nbsp;<b>KCPSS Football CCA</b>&nbsp;is to inculcate values such as teamwork, resilience as well as good sportsmanship in all our students. The teachers-in-charge, together with our coaches, aim to create a respectful, positive and healthy environment for our students to improve their individual technical skills and conditioning as well as their understanding and appreciation of team play.</p>

### Area of Focus

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">Every player, coach and teacher in KCPSS knows that Football is a highly physical game that requires great mental strength, strong physique and clever wits. Not only that, it requires a great amount of team work that only through&nbsp;<b>good relationships with team mates</b>&nbsp;will it be accomplished.&nbsp;</p>

  

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">Last but certainly not the least, Football requires&nbsp;<b>discipline in character</b>&nbsp;that makes him a Holistic player whom people hold with high regards. It is in these principles that the&nbsp;<b>KCPSS Football Team</b>&nbsp;is built on - every player to graduate from KCPSS with the knowledge of Football, the health and physique of a true athlete, relationships with team mates that lasts and character that brings every player through life.</p>
