## Shooting

### Vision

<img src="/images/The%20Kuo%20Chuan%20Experience/CCA/Shooting/vision.jpeg" style="width:40%;margin-right:15px;" align="left">

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">Co-curricular activities play an integral role in a student's life, be it at the primary, secondary, or tertiary level. They are an essential contribution in achieving a student's holistic education in school. A combination of skill, attitude, and principles contribute to making a successful Shooter. <br><br>
The Shooting Clubâ€™s vision is for our shooters to be leaders with precision, and a marksman with a resolute heart and mind.</p>


### Area of Focus

<img src="/images/The%20Kuo%20Chuan%20Experience/CCA/Shooting/area_of_focus.jpeg" style="width:40%;margin-right:15px;" align="left">


<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">The shooting CCA aims to develop our students to be skillful shooters of the Air Pistol or Air Rifle. Regardless of experience in the field of shooting, we train every member to his or her fullest potential.<br><br> 
Over the 4 to 5 years of CCA trainings, students grow to be confident users of the guns, armed with the technical and mental skills to take on national competitions. <br><br> 
Emphasis is also placed on their physical training to condition their fitness and health; this ensures our shooters are strengthened from within. <br><br>
Teachable moments during CCA sessions are tapped on for character building and, strong bonds are built between the teachers, students and coaches to establish good lines of communication and understanding.
