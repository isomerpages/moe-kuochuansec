### Vision

<img src="/images/The%20Kuo%20Chuan%20Experience/CCA/Drama/drama1.jpg" style="width:40%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

The KCPSS Drama club is committed to helping our students realise their dramatic and/or artistic potential and providing opportunities for our members to showcase their talent. In our Drama club, talent is not limited to acting and extends to various aspects of theatre production, including script writing, set designing and stage management. KCPSS is a mission school and we are committed to inculcating G.R.A.C.E values in all our trainings and programmes.

### Area of Focus

<img src="/images/The%20Kuo%20Chuan%20Experience/CCA/Drama/drama2.jpg" style="width:40%;margin-right:15px;" align = "left">

Each of our training sessions focus on exploring the self through fundamentals of drama training, ensemble work, characterisation and voice. Drama students are also given opportunities to explore their individual interests in script writing, theatre production and management.  

 We focus on a yearly drama production for National Day, and biannually for the Singapore Youth Festival and KCPSS Performing Arts Showcase.

In addition, our drama students are taken each year to watch a drama production as part of ‘aesthetic exposure’ in their drama curriculum.
