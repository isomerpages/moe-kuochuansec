### Vision

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">
The KCPSS Drama club is committed to helping our students realise their dramatic and/or artistic potential and providing opportunities for our members to showcase their talent. In our Drama club, talent is not limited to acting and extends to various aspects of theatre production, including script writing, set designing and stage management. KCPSS is a mission school and we are committed to inculcating G.R.A.C.E values in all our trainings and programmes.</p>

### Area of Focus

<img src="/images/The%20Kuo%20Chuan%20Experience/CCA/Drama/drama2.jpg" style="width:40%;margin-right:15px;" align="left">

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">
Each training session focuses on the fundamentals of drama training, ensemble work, characterisation and voice work.

Drama students are also given opportunities to explore their individual interests in script writing, theatre production and management.

Drama students also participate in a Drama exchange programme with other secondary schools.</p>
