Art Club adopts a holistic approach in developing character in every member. It offers opportunities and platforms for them to learn the relevant knowledge, skills and values that will help every individual to take on the challenges of the 21st century. We believe that through our varied art practices and programmes, students will be equipped to be more aware, informed and appreciative of the visual arts and be an active contributor to the school and community.

### Area of Focus

Art Club aims to nurture in every Art Clubber an informed awareness and appreciation of the visual arts. It provides opportunities for its members to express their ideas creatively in visual and tactile forms. Members will develop competency in the use of art and design principles, materials and processes. It fosters and nurtures self-confidence and develops in every member a sense of achievement through the practice of visual arts. Art Club also aims to cultivate in every member to be a lifelong learner who has able to appreciate and be passionate for the visual arts and contribute to the school and community.
