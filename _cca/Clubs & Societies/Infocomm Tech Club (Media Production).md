The Infocom CCA aims to help aspiring young students, with or without prior ICT related experience, to learn the various software skills and showcase their expertise in national competitions. We also aim to give students the platforms to taste success, facilitate learning of social skills outside of the classroom setup. Despite the focus in striving for success, we also put strong emphasis in ensuring that our students are equipped with 21st skills and be workplace ready.
