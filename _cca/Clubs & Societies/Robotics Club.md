**1. Fun-filled Learning Experience:** We engage students in an enjoyable and educational journey. Through interactive sessions, we immerse students in the fascinating world of robotics, making learning both fun and rewarding.
**2. Robot Designing, Building and Programming:** We emphasize practical skills development by using the Lego Spike Prime and Mindstorms EV3 sets. Students learn how to design, construct and program robots, gaining valuable hands-on experience in the process.
**3. Competition and Talent Showcase:** We provide a platform for students with a passion for robot building and programming to develop their potential. By participating in national-level competitions, students can exhibit their talents, test their skills against peers, and gain recognition for their achievements.

**<u>Training</u>**

Robotics&nbsp; Club is actively inculcating aspiring students who aspire to be future robotics engineers and programmers. The club constantly strive to develop studentsâ€™ robot construction and programming skills through exposure to a variety of robotics fields and engaging professional trainers for training. Students will be given ample opportunities to compete in various national competitions to pitch their skills against the best to create the strongest, smartest or fastest robot. Apart from that, students are also given opportunities to develop their leadership and management skills through committee postings as well as student leader positions during internal events such as School Open House Day.
