<p><strong>Mission</strong>
</p>
<p>The Mission of the Girls' Brigade is Every girl a leader, every officer
a servant leader. The aim of the Girls' Brigade is to help girls in Kuo
Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School develop into ladies who embrace our
school values of G.R.A.C.E. Through self-control, reverence and a sense
of responsibility, we endeavour the girls to find true enrichment in life.
The 28th Coy aspires to lead each and every Brigadier to achieve her fullest
potential, building them up in the 21st Century skills as active community
contributors, fulfilling the Girls' Brigade mission of raising every girl
to be a leader and every officer to be a servant leader.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 28th Girls' Brigade Singapore Company started in 1989 and has since
been growing steadily, gaining much recognition within the Girls' Brigade,
Singapore.</p>

<p>The programmes in Girlsâ€™ Brigade are designed to cater towards the holistic
development of the child.</p>
<p>Through the engaging and interesting activities planned out for them,
our girls discover their interests and talents. They also develop much
values and competencies through these activities, which are needed in this
rapidly changing society.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In their years with us, girls also find support through friends as they
work together and grow as lifelong learners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some highlights of our activities include archery, indoor rock climbing,
kayaking and dancing! These learning experiences serve as platforms for
our girls to grow as servant leaders and scholars.</p>
