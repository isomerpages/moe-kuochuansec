### Vision

**<u>Mission</u>**  
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">The Mission of the Girls' Brigade is Every girl a leader, every officer a servant leader. The aim of the Girls' Brigade is to help girls in Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School develop into ladies who embrace our school values of G.R.A.C.E. Through self-control, reverence and a sense of responsibility, we endeavour the girls to find true enrichment in life. The 28th Coy aspires to lead each and every Brigadier to achieve her fullest potential, building them up in the 21st Century skills as active community contributors, fulfilling the Girls' Brigade mission of raising every girl to be a leader and every officer to be a servant leader.&nbsp;</p>  
  
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">The 28th Girls' Brigade Singapore Company started in 1989 and has since been growing steadily, gaining much recognition within the Girls' Brigade, Singapore.</p>&nbsp;

### Area of Focus

<img src="/images/The%20Kuo%20Chuan%20Experience/CCA/Girls%20Brigade/gb2.jpg" style="width:30%;margin-right:15px;" align="left">

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">The programmes in Girlsâ€™ Brigade are designed to cater towards the holistic development of the child.  
  
Through the engaging and interesting activities planned out for them, our girls discover their interests and talents. They also develop much values and competencies through these activities, which are needed in this rapidly changing society.&nbsp;  
  
In their years with us, girls also find support through friends as they work together and grow as lifelong learners.&nbsp;  
  
Some highlights of our activities include archery, indoor rock climbing, kayaking and dancing! These learning experiences serve as platforms for our girls to grow as servant leaders and scholars.</p>
