<p><strong>Mission</strong>:</p>
<p>The Girl Guides' mission is to enable girls and young women to develop
their fullest potential as responsible citizens of the world. Popularly
known as KCP 1st Coy, we work very closely with this mission. We organise
many activities to maximise the potential of our girls, explore new possibilities,
achieve personal goals while making friends and having fun.</p>
<p>The Guide Promise to us is very crucial and it is the pivot behind Girl
Guiding: I promise to do my best, To do my duty to God, To serve my country
and help other people, and to keep the Guide Law.</p>
<p>We also follow the 10 Guide Laws:&nbsp;
<br>A Guide is loyal and can be trusted
<br>A Guide is useful and helps others
<br>A Guide is polite, considerate and respects her elders
<br>A Guide is friendly and a sister to all Guides
<br>A Guide is kind to all living things
<br>A Guide is obedient
<br>A Guide has courage and is cheerful in all difficulties
<br>A Guide takes care of her own possessions and those of other people
<br>A Guide Is thrifty and diligent
<br>A Guide is self-disciplined in what she thinks, says and does 2 Area</p>

<p>Our motto,&nbsp;<strong>"Be Prepared"</strong>&nbsp;, shares the Founder's
initials and is a practical reminder of the educational purposes of Girl
Guiding. KCP 1st Coy aims to provide girls with the opportunity for self-training
in character development, responsible citizenship and in service to the
community. We adhere to our motto:&nbsp;<strong>'Be Prepared' - 'Think it. Say it. Live it'</strong>.</p>

<p>KCP 1st Coy&nbsp;is certainly a CCA like no other. We have a wide range
of activities, which allows our members to acquire new skills and be exposed
to all kinds of situations. This includes outdoor cooking, foot drills,
gadget-making, as well as earning proficiency badges and going for overseas
trips and camps. Most of our training is based on the&nbsp;Five-Point programme&nbsp;,
which covers personal and social development, housekeeping skills, camping
skills, community involvement and knowledge on worldwide issues. One of
the highlights is our&nbsp;<u>Annual camp and Sec 1 Orientation Campfire</u>&nbsp;where
our guides portray their talents and skills. We also render numerous community
services, which include raising funds for Thinking Day Pennies, walkathon,
Yeoman Services and selling cookies for Girl Guides Singapore with a serving
heart and mind From these activities and competitions, we build strong
friendships, share our joy and sorrow, learn the meaning of teamwork and
overcome problems as sister guides.</p>
