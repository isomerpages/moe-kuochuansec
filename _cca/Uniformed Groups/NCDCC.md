### Vision

National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) is a National Uniformed Group under the purview of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Home Affairs, Singapore Civil Defence Force. NCDCC believes in developing and empowering our youths to be active & concerned citizens with life-saving skills. NCDCC began its journey in 2005, with the focus to develop greater awareness of civil defence in our cadets and prepare them with the skills to respond effectively to emergencies at home and abroad. The attitude of readiness against adversity and practical skills which are critical in the face of danger and emergencies are life-long capabilities that our young civil defence ambassadors can have. NCDCC’s motto of “We Learn, We Lead, We Serve”, in alignment to the 3 big ideas in Character and Citizenship Education: “Identity, Relationships and Choices”, well encapsulates the journey of NCDCC cadets into three phases:

    <td>Cadets learn Triangle Of Life skills, which include basic firefighting, first aid and CPR+AED. These are core skills in NCDCC, which enable cadets to help themselves and others in times of need.
