<p>National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC) is a National Uniformed Group
under the purview of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Home
Affairs, Singapore Civil Defence Force. NCDCC believes in developing and
empowering our youths to be active &amp; concerned citizens with life-saving
skills. NCDCC began its journey in 2005, with the focus to develop greater
awareness of civil defence in our cadets and prepare them with the skills
to respond effectively to emergencies at home and abroad. The attitude
of readiness against adversity and practical skills which are critical
in the face of danger and emergencies are life-long capabilities that our
young civil defence ambassadors can have. NCDCC’s motto of “We Learn, We
Lead, We Serve”, in alignment to the 3 big ideas in Character and Citizenship
Education: “Identity, Relationships and Choices”, well encapsulates the
journey of NCDCC cadets into three phases:</p>
