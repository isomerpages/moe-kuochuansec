**Secondary 2 – Film and Broadcasting , Storyboard, and Video Log**



<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">
Students tried their hand at being young film-makers as they crafted a broadcasting script and produced a storyboard for a news broadcast.   In view of the COVID-19 safety measures this year, the students were tasked to complete an adapted version of the Sec 2 Film &amp; Broadcasting programme. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">
The 2 Express students created a video log of their book collection and the books that they have read during the circuit breaker period. They incorporated the use of various camera angles and creative editing to captivate their audience and express their love for reading. </p>  

 <p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">
The 2NA students were involved in producing broadcast videos based on the school's GRACE values. They had to collaborate from home and stitch the various parts of their scenes together which inculcated a sense of responsibility and co-operation on every student’s part.</p>
