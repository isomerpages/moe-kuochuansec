<h2>Secondary 2</h2>
<p><strong>Secondary 2 – Film and Broadcasting , Storyboard, and Video Log</strong>
</p>
<p>“Every Secondary 2 student in KCPSS will try their hand at being young
film-makers as they craft a talkshow script and produce a storyboard for
their very own talkshow.</p>
<p>Students get into groups and go through the entire creative process, from
brainstorming the theme of their talkshow to eventually stitching it together.
They watch their efforts come to life and learn to be a media producer.
For many young ones, this is surely an exciting opportunity.</p>
<p>Hosted in our very own Mustard Seed studio, students learn to handle specialised
equipment and learn from experts in the field. Our vendors have a track
record for being excellent and experienced in all things media.</p>
<p>Through this process, our students learn to be more critical and savvy
consumers and producers of media.”</p>
