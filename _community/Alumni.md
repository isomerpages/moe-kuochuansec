### President's Message

<div align="justify">
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">
Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Schools Alumni founded in 1992, after the Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School and Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School were formed with a&nbsp;<b>Mission</b>&nbsp;to provide former students with opportunities to interact and network, and the schools with support to be&nbsp;<b>Aflame For Truth</b>&nbsp;in the education of their students. </p> 
  
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">
Although newly organised as a primary and a secondary school, they were the successors to two much older schools - the Presbyterian Boys' School and the Kuo Chuan Girls's School. The Presbyterian Boys's School was in turn the successor to Dryburgh English School and Choon Guan English School.  </p>
  
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">
Whereas the two sister schools founded by the Presbyterian mission were separated by sex, now they are separated according to the level - primary or secondary.</p>  
  
<p style="text-align: justify;font-size:16px;">
In the past there were the Presbyterian Old Boys' Association and the Kuo Chuan Old Girls' Association; the logical conclusion now was to have one Association catering to the old students of both schools.</p></div>
