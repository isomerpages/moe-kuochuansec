<h3>President's Message</h3>
<p><strong>Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Schools Alumni Association</strong>
</p>
<p>Dear Fellow Alumni,</p>
<p>It is with deep gratitude and great anticipation that I step into the
role of President of the Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Schools Alumni Association
— a community that spans generations of Presbyterian Boys, Kuo Chuan Girls,
Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Schools united by shared memories, values, and a
school that shaped us profoundly.</p>
<p>For me, KCPS is more than a school. It is where I shaped my formative
years, forged lifelong friendships, and met my wife — a fellow alumnus
— whose journey also began in these very compound. The lessons I learnt
here, both in and beyond the classroom, continue to guide me today.</p>
<p>Now, it is time for us — the alumni — to write a new chapter.</p>
<p>We stand at a pivotal moment. The world is changing rapidly, and so must
we. I envision a bold transformation of our alumni community: one that
is vibrant, inclusive, and deeply connected to the heartbeat of the school.
A community that doesn’t just look back with nostalgia, but steps forward
with purpose.</p>
<p>Let us rekindle our ties not just with each other, but with the schools
and its students walking the same corridors we once did. Let us be mentors,
supporters, and champions for the next generation. Whether through time,
talent, or resources, every contribution matters. When we give back, we
don’t just honour our past — we invest in the future.</p>
<p>I humbly call on each of you to support my team to make a difference to
the schools and to our future generations that the schools touches. <strong>Support the schools. Support the students. Pay it forward.</strong>
</p>
<p>Together, we can build a legacy of service, generosity, and pride. I invite
you to join me in this renewed mission — to serve, to uplift, and to inspire.
As I build my management committee, I like to hear from you, on your ideas
or if you like to volunteer and join me.</p>
<p>With faith and fellowship,</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Chung</strong>
