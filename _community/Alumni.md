<h2>ALUMNI</h2>
<h3>President's Message</h3>
<p>Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Schools Alumni founded in 1992, after the Kuo Chuan
Presbyterian Primary School and Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School
were formed with a&nbsp;<strong>Mission</strong>&nbsp;to provide former
students with opportunities to interact and network, and the schools with
support to be&nbsp;<strong>Aflame For Truth</strong>&nbsp;in the education
of their students.</p>
<p>Although newly organised as a primary and a secondary school, they were
the successors to two much older schools - the Presbyterian Boys' School
and the Kuo Chuan Girls's School. The Presbyterian Boys's School was in
turn the successor to Dryburgh English School and Choon Guan English School.</p>
<p>Whereas the two sister schools founded by the Presbyterian mission were
separated by sex, now they are separated according to the level - primary
or secondary.</p>
<p>In the past there were the Presbyterian Old Boys' Association and the
Kuo Chuan Old Girls' Association; the logical conclusion now was to have
one Association catering to the old students of both schools.</p>
