### Chairperson's message

Dear Parents of KCPian,

<p style="text-align: justify;">Greetings from the KCPian EXCO Team! A heartfelt welcome to the Parents Support Group (PSG) of Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School (KCPSS).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">At KCPSS, we strongly believe that the collaboration and engagement of parents are crucial for the positive growth and development of our children. Having served on the PSG Exco for nine years, I've actively participated in various KCPSS-PSG events with my children, such as Cross Country, Youth Day, National Day, and the Thanksgiving Ceremony. This active involvement signals to my children that I'm invested in their learning journeys and interested in their school life, providing me with the assurance that they are thriving in a nurturing environment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In essence, becoming a PSG member offers you the opportunity to foster a strong relationship with our school leaders and teachers, connect with fellow parents, exchange parenting tips, and create cherished memories with your child through regular participation in school and PSG activities.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">We extend a warm invitation for you to join us in any of our activities throughout the school term whenever your schedule permits. Embrace the chance to be part of the KCPSS Parent Support Group, where together, we can bring out the best in our children.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Let's collaboratively nurture every KCPian into a Servant Leader and a Scholar.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength." - Mark 12:30</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"I actively seek and live by God's wisdom: therefore, I am highly favored and esteemed in the sight of God and men." - Proverbs 3:1-4</p>

Warm blessings,

Patricia Tan<br>
Chair, KCPSS Parent Support Group
