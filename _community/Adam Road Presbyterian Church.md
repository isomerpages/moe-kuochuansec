<p align="center">Matthew 5:14-16<br> 
You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. </p>

<p align="justify">Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School has been blessed with the sure and steady partnership of Adam Road Presbyterian Church (ARPC) since 2014. The Chaplaincy Team from ARPC, led by Reverend Dr Adrin Muñoz, has worked in tandem with the school to serve and bless our staff and students, through the sharing of morning messages, Thank God It’s Friday (TGIF) services, Breakfast and Prayer sessions, and other outreach efforts. Together with the strong rapport in Christ, we look forward to the continual partnership to build a school community anchored in values and faith.</p> 

# What We Do
<p align="justify">The Chaplaincy Team reaches out to the broader school community through the daily morning messages in which our school’s GRACE values are anchored on, delivered according to weekly themes. These morning messages eventually culminate in the Thank God It’s Friday (TGIF) services where the school gathers and gives thanks for the week. </p>
<p align="justify">In addition, the Chaplaincy Team hosts a space where students can drop by for a chat and participate in various activities during recess breaks. Breakfast and Prayer on Tuesday mornings and afternoon activities, e.g. terrarium-making workshops are some of these outreach efforts to bless the school. Our staff are also blessed with the love and generosity from the Chaplaincy Team who serve freshly brewed coffee and tea every week, as well as timely snack energisers throughout the year.

 Blessed with the support of the ARPC Chaplaincy team
<p align="justify">The partnership efforts with the Chaplaincy Team extends beyond the physical to the spiritual as well. Pastor Adrin’s exhortations during staff events often serve to uplift and anchor staff on Christ in our work as a school. </p>

# Holy Week 2024
<p align="justify">Holy Week 2024 took place in the first week of April, where we commemorated Christ’s death and resurrection, encouraging Christian staff and students to draw closer to God in our walk with Him. Our theme for Holy Week this year is ‘From Darkness to Light’, focusing our attention on the Hope that Christ brings.  </p>
<p align="justify">During that week, we welcomed students to join us for a series of activities during recess breaks and after school. We hosted our usual movie screening ‘I Can Only Imagine’ after school, and also set up a games booth and books exhibit from Our Daily Bread, where students could interact with one another and learn about the gospel. The highlight had to be a special busking programme by the ARPC band during recess. 
 </p>
<p align="justify">Together with the Christian Education Team, our internal Remembrance and Celebration session, Strong Knees, was held at Praise Hall – where Christian staff and students gathered to worship, fellowship, share testimonies and pray. This year we enjoyed some simple foods - curries, naans and dates, and were uplifted by the sharing of Joel Ang (3 Peace) and Mr Yap Shinn (Assistant Year Head, Upper Sec) share about their experience living in Christ. 
 </p>
<p align="justify">We praise God for a powerful and enriching time of fellowship leading up to Good Friday and Resurrection Sunday!

# Prayer Support
<p align="justify">The Chaplaincy Team and teachers gather for a weekly prayer meet online on Sunday evenings. In Term 4, we hosted a Prayer and Encouragement Session, where students gathered for a time of fellowship and prayer, in the midst of the intensifying examination preparation. The Chaplaincy Team led us to cast our cares on Jesus (1 Peter 5:7) and find comfort and strength in God. </p>
