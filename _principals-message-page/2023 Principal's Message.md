<p>Greetings!</p><p>It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School. We are a Presbyterian mission school with a long heritage, anchored in values and faith, and are proud to be a part of the Bishan-Toa Payoh community. We aspire to be a School on a Hill, with our KCPians going forth to shine their light, wherever they may go.</p><p>14 “You are the light of the world. A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. 15 Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 16 In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven. Matthew 5:14-16</p><p>Over the years, we have developed a strong school-based curriculum that has brought out the best in every KCPian. As an inclusive school that seeks to be at the heart of our communities, we have embraced students of all ability-levels and backgrounds, guiding them in their growth and nurturing in them a desire to learn for life, and to make a difference in society and Singapore.</p><p>We do this with a focus on quality programmes and relationships, which imbue our school with a positive and uplifting culture. Our stakeholders and staff serve with faith and commitment, providing students with a wide range of experiences that develop in them their passions and purpose in life. This in turn gives them the confidence and resilience to overcome challenges, and to seize opportunities that come their way.</p><p>7 “But blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; whose confidence is in him.<br>8 They will be like a tree planted by the water<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that sends out its roots by the stream.<br>It does not fear when heat comes;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; its leaves are always green.<br>It has no worries in a year of drought<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and never fails to bear fruit.”<br>Jeremiah 17:7-8</p><p>In 2024, we look forward to our Centennial. God's faithfulness has seen us through decades of growth and impact, and has also allowed us to emerge stronger from COVID. If you are looking for a vibrant school that will be a life-long community, providing comprehensive and quality education, while embracing our GRACE values (God-Fearing, Resilience, Agape, Conscientiousness and Empathy), look no further. Join us, and be aflame for truth!</p><p>Mr Justin Tan</p><p>Principal</p>
