## 2023 Principal's Message


Dear all,

  

2021 has been a year of discovery and new beginnings for Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School. Students, staff and the community have continued to show tremendous fortitude and resilience as we have adapted and persevered through various challenging and difficult moments this year. Indeed, it has been God's faithfulness, together with a strong sense of solidarity, faith and hope, that has seen us through the year.

  

Through many experiences, we have discovered new qualities and aspects of our character and identity as a school. As Singapore moves forward into a new phase in the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a need for individuals and communities to step up and do their part. In doing so, we will be able to secure a future as a nation and people. In KCPSS, we have embraced this responsibility and continued to achieve strong educational outcomes and experiences through our activities and programmes. 

  

This has been made possible through the sterling efforts of our staff, initiative and drive of our students, and the leadership and service shown by our stakeholders and community. It is the healthy, vibrant relationships that exist between these that has built a strong foundation for key aspects of our KCPSS experience. These include a clear focus on our spiritual roots and mission, emphasis on student and staff well-being, and an inclusive and uplifting school learning environment.

  

With this foundation, KCPSS will continue to grow from strength to strength. This is evident from the way the school has embraced new dimensions of education, from new initiatives such as the Personalised Digital Learning Programme (PDLP) and Blended Learning, to an expansion of our Direct School Admission (DSA) Talent Areas to include the performing arts and our Applied Learning Programme in Media Literacy. As we look to the future, I am confident that we will continue to provide each KCPian with a vibrant, comprehensive and balanced experience across all learning domains, preparing them for the future. 

  

We can do this because of your support, regardless of whether you are a student, alumnus, staff, parent, community partner or stakeholder. Do continue to bless the school and community with your presence, efforts and more. If you are considering KCPSS as a school of choice for your child, I encourage you to explore this website, our social media presence, and to reach out to us to learn more.

  

Indeed, this year, I have been touched and impressed by the generosity, commitment and compassion of many in our midst. KCPSS has certainly continued to grow in our role at the heart of our communities! May we continue to be blessed, and to bless many, in our learning and service.

  

To God be the Glory!
