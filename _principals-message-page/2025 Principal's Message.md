### Taking Flight: Soaring with Renewed Strength

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.<br>
	<b>Isaiah 40:31</b>
</p>
<p style="text-align:justify">It is with joy and hope that we begin 2025. Over the course of 2024, the Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Schools were able to celebrate our 100th anniversary with a deep sense of thanksgiving and renewal. With confidence in God's provision and faithfulness, we now look to the future.<br><br>
KCPSS is a School on a Hill, shining our light for our students, families, community and Singapore. With your support and presence, we have been able to strengthen our focus on student well- being, educational technology and deepening our faith and focus on our school values of GRACE.<br><br>
In 2025, we would like to invite you to lean in further, and work with our teachers and stakeholders to ensure that your child has the best opportunity to thrive and flourish. Our emphasis for students will be to strengthen their academic foundation, even as they make the most of the flexibility provided for by FSBB. Over the years, they will develop a strong sense of place and identity, as our newly-launched House system and #TeamKCP spirit provides platforms for positive relationships, support and growth.	</p>
