### Taking Flight: Soaring with Renewed Strength

<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;"> But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.<br>
	<b>Isaiah 40:31</b>

Over the course of 2024, the Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Schools were able to celebrate our 100th anniversary with a deep sense of thanksgiving and renewal. With confidence in God's provision and faithfulness, we now look to the future.</p>
