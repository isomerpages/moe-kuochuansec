### Parents

Dear Parents / Guardians,<br><br>
Our [Parenting Support Provider (PSP), TOUCH Community Services](/files/Useful%20Links/Parents/TOUCH%20Parenting%20Update%20(April%202020).pdf), has created a document comprising information and links to parenting and family related resources that may be helpful for our reading and reference especially for this Circuit Breaker period.

They are also in the works of planning complimentary webinars on how we can foster healthy digital habits together as a family, as well as how we can help our children in varied cyber wellness related issues (screen time, gaming, cyber bullying, inappropriate content, etc). There is a link to a short feedback survey within the document â€“ your response will help them in determining the topic/s and schedules for the webinars.

If you require additional parenting support through this period, you may also find the necessary contact details within the document.

We hope that you will find this resource helpful to you.

With regards<br>
Imm Ki and Abby Choo
