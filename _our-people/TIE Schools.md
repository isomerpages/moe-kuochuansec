### The Kuo Chuan Trips for International Experience


**As part of the Kuo Chuan Experience, students have the opportunities to go for the Trips for International Experience (TIE) to visit the various partners that we have. The trips and partners are chosen with the following objectives in mind:**

**<u>PURPOSE OF TIE</u>**

1\. Develop in our students the 21st century competencies of global awareness and cross-cultural skills and sensitivities;

2\. Expose students to Asia and the world, and sensitise them to Singapore’s place in the world;

3\. Deepen students’ commitment and rootedness to Singapore; and

4\. Develop our students to be servant leaders, self-directed learners and a community contributors.

The various exchange programme allows the KCPians to immerse in the culture of their counterparts and allow them to develop and enhance their 21st century competencies in a globalised world. They learn to appreciate, interact and learn from their peers on the lessons they can apply for themselves as Servant Leaders and Scholars. Through the interaction, KCPians are also able to forge a deeper understanding of Singapore’s role in the world.

 Across the years, our Kuo Chuan students have been to South Korea, China and Vietnam to experience the different school system as well as gain meaningful friendships with their peers. Our partnership with Suzhou Loufeng School (China) and Suncheon Maesan Middle School (South Korea) had been long standing and fruitful. In 2018, we started the partnership with Thuc Nghiem Experimental Secondary School in Hanoi (Vietnam) and we hope to bring this partnership to greater heights in the future.

KCPians have also gone to Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand for their Values In Action (VIA) Programmes where they gained valuable insights in the lives of those who are in need and develop a sense of empathy and purpose in their own lives. Through these overseas VIA opportunities, our students developed resilience and learned to be adaptable in the different environments and situations that they are in. They learned to improvise when things go wrong and be the support for their friends as they worked in teams.

Through TIE, we hope to further develop our KCPians as future-ready Servant Leaders and Scholars who encompass and display the school’s G.R.A.C.E values.
