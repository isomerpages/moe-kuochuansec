**ENGLISH DEPARTMENT**<br>
**A creative and critical thinker, who is a voice for change**

## PROGRAMMES


The Department of English and Literature offers a variety of language-enriched literary programmes to pique studentsâ€™ passion for English and Literature respectively. The Department recognises the diverse learning abilities of students, and therefore places strong emphasis in programmes which are&nbsp;**differentiated**&nbsp;to the needs of these groups.

Students become confident speakers, taking ownership of their learning. Podcasting serves as a platform for each student to vocalise their thoughts.</span><br><br><span style="color:#292929">Before students start recording, scaffolds are usually put in place to enable learning and for them to perform to the best of their abilities. Students are taught reading aloud oral communication skills. They also learn about the structure of writing a speech followed by carrying out process writing of the speech. Students will have hands-on experience with the recorder application in the iPad to record their podcast. Finally, as the finishing touch, students will edit their podcast and add the finishing touches i.e. background music to their podcast.</span></td>

    <td class="tg-2l0r">The Secondary 2EN cohort put their media literacy skills to the test in an innovative interdisciplinary project marrying expository writing for English and film literacy for Literature. Students are given the task of composing pictures using framing and mise-en-scene techniques learnt in their film theory module during their Literature lessons, to complement and showcase the argument of their expository paragraphs, in this level-wide ALP initiative.</td>
