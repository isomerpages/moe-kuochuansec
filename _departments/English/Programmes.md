## PROGRAMMES


The Department of English and Literature offers a variety of language-enriched literary programmes to pique students’ passion for English and Literature respectively. The Department recognises the diverse learning abilities of students, and therefore places strong emphasis in programmes which are&nbsp;**differentiated**&nbsp;to the needs of these groups.

  
**Sec 1 Podcasting**

The Secondary One students embark on recording a podcast as an Alternative Assessment over a few weeks. Students become confident speakers, taking ownership of their learning. Podcasting serves as a platform for each student to vocalise their thoughts.

  

Before students start recording, scaffolds are usually put in place to enable learning and for them to perform to the best of their abilities. Students are taught reading aloud oral communication skills. They also learn about the structure of writing a speech followed by carrying out process writing of the speech. Students will have hands-on experience with the recorder application in the iPad to record their podcast. Finally, as the finishing touch, students will edit their podcast and add the finishing touches i.e. background music to their podcast.


**Sec 2 Film &amp; Broadcasting**

The Secondary 2EN cohort put their media literacy skills to the test in an innovative interdisciplinary project marrying expository writing for English and film literacy for Literature. Students are given the task of composing pictures using framing and mise-en-scene techniques learnt in their film theory module during their Literature lessons, to complement and showcase the argument of their expository paragraphs, in this level-wide ALP initiative.

The English Language First is a support programme for selected Lower Secondary students to provide the necessary learning support for students to bridge their learning gaps in the English Language. To ensure early intervention, diagnostic tests are administered at the start of Secondary One&nbsp; to ascertain the language proficiency of every student. Students who require more support would then be identified for the English Language First programme, to help them establish the fundamental understanding of the language at an early stage. Some of the areas of focus of the English Language First programmes are:  
  

*   Grammar application
*   Vocabulary acquisition
*   Synthesis and transformation
*   Reading skills

**Set Text Prose**  

Pure Literature students will study a prose text. It is a Dystopian novel which introduces a dystopic society where censorship and thought suppression is prevalent. Books, which are considered dangerous and evil, are banned. Individuality and thinking are viewed as threats to social stability and the population is controlled through its consumption of media, which serves as an endless stream of distractions to its passive and addicted audience. This novel raises questions about the influence of mass media and the dangers of being ignorant and illiterate.
