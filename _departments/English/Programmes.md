## PROGRAMMES


The Department of English and Literature offers a variety of language-enriched literary programmes to pique students’ passion for English and Literature respectively. The Department recognises the diverse learning abilities of students, and therefore places strong emphasis in programmes which are&nbsp;**differentiated**&nbsp;to the needs of these groups.

  
**Sec 1 Podcasting**


![](/images/Our%20People/Departments/English/EL%20Prog%201.jpg)

The Secondary One students embark on recording a podcast as an Alternative Assessment over a few weeks. Students become confident speakers, taking ownership of their learning. Podcasting serves as a platform for each student to vocalise their thoughts.

  

Before students start recording, scaffolds are usually put in place to enable learning and for them to perform to the best of their abilities. Students are taught reading aloud oral communication skills. They also learn about the structure of writing a speech followed by carrying out process writing of the speech. Students will have hands-on experience with the recorder application in the iPad to record their podcast. Finally, as the finishing touch, students will edit their podcast and add the finishing touches i.e. background music to their podcast.


**Sec 2 Film &amp; Broadcasting**

The English Language First is a support programme for selected Lower Secondary students to provide the necessary learning support for students to bridge their learning gaps in the English Language. To ensure early intervention, diagnostic tests are administered at the start of Secondary One&nbsp; to ascertain the language proficiency of every student. Students who require more support would then be identified for the English Language First programme, to help them establish the fundamental understanding of the language at an early stage. Some of the areas of focus of the English Language First programmes are:  
  

*   Grammar application
*   Vocabulary acquisition

**Sec 1EN Literature Set Text**

Inspired by a true story, August (Auggie) Pullman was born with a severe facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Wonder begins from Auggie's point of view, but soon switches to include the perspectives of his family members and classmates. These voices converge to portray a community as it struggles with differences, and challenges readers, both young and old, to wonder about the true nature of empathy, compassion, acceptance and friendship. Auggie is a hero for the ages, one who proves that you can’t blend in when you were born to stand out.

Our Sec 1s are encouraged to take part in activities that help inculcate this sense of compassion and kindness. Through putting themselves in the shoes of Auggie and other characters, they truly learn and see the importance of being, ultimately, kind.
