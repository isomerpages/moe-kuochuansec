**<u>ART:</u>**<br>
**Overview of the Art Curriculum**<br>
The Art curriculum aims to enable students to be visually literate and appreciate art.  The Lower Secondary Art Programme aims to introduce Artistic Literacy in students to appreciate and communicate their ideas effectively through Art.

The Upper Secondary Art focuses on the Consolidation and Refinement of Knowledge, Skills and Techniques required for the Art students to prepare effectively  for their ‘N’ and ’O’ Level Art papers.



**Secondary 1 (Art-effect)**<br>
Secondary 1 students will engage in the School Curriculum Innovation (SCI) theme of ‘Art-effect’ where Art is introduced to create an effect in their lives. Students will be involved in interesting and engaging projects such as Trading Card design, Pottery making, Values-driven, Innovation and Enterprise (I&E) and Socially impactful work.

**Secondary 2 (Art-Marketplace)**<br>
Secondary 2 students will create a buzz in Art, working in greater depth and breadth of Art Essentials though the various Art forms and materials (in 2D and 3D). Projects like Toy design using ICT, Corporate logo design and Packaging with Innovation and Enterprise and National Education coupled with 21st Century Competencies contextual work.

Lower Secondary students will embark on Learning Journeys to Museum visits for exposure of Artwork of Artists as well as understanding and appreciating the social & cultural history of Art.


**Secondary 3 (Articulate)** <br>
Secondary 3 students will be able to express and communicate their learnings of Art clearly after a series of rigorous studio practice, mastering Art Essentials, consolidating, refining their knowledge and processes, skills and techniques required.


**Secondary 4 (Arteria)** <br>
Secondary 4 & 5 Art students will be well- equipped and better prepared for their GCE ‘N’ and ‘O’ Level Coursework projects and their Drawing and Painting Paper 2 for their national examinations. 

Art Learning Journeys and Art-related Polytechnic and Art schools Open Houses will be organised for Upper Secondary Art students for better exposure and to make informed choices of the post-secondary Art & Design education available to them. Besides, the school is in partnership with Nanyang Polytechnic to offer Advanced Elective Module to the students.

**<u>Design & Technology:</u>**

**Overview of the Design & Technology Curriculum** <br>
The D & T curriculum is designed as such that students are immersed in the learning of various design thinking and concepts progressively throughout the 4/5 years of their secondary school years. All students undergo an authentic and rigorous curriculum and assessment through self-directed and collaborative learning in project works as well as School Curriculum Innovations (SCI).

Throughout the 4/5 years of learning, the students are also constantly and pervasively exposed to the use of ICT as well as the honing of their 21st century competencies as they embark in their projects and assessments.


**Secondary 1 (Design Discovery)**<br>
As the subject of Design & Technology is relatively unfamiliar and unlike the other subjects that the Secondary 1 students have taken before, the lower secondary curriculum aims to excite and bring awareness of the concept of design and what is this subject all about. The students will understand and become aware that design exists not just in exhibitions and buildings, but also in their daily life such as a simple table as well as a children's toy. Besides, the students learn various technical skills such as drilling, filing as well as sanding which will help equip them in their spatial awareness.

**Secondary 2 (Design Community)** <br>
Having been exposed to the fundamentals of Design & Technology in Secondary 1, the Secondary 2 students will now be taught to widen their perception and scope of design beyond the 4 walls of the classroom and into their community. Infusing National Education (NE) into the curriculum, the students will be tasked to solve an ill-defined problem faced by the very community they lived in such as design and making a product to aid the elderly in their daily functional activity at home. Besides, the students will learn various technical skills at an intermediate level such as bending and forming which will help further equip them in their spatial awareness.

**Secondary 3 (Design Immersion)** <br>
Building on the foundations that have been laid out for the first 2 years, the curriculum at this level would be to equip the Secondary 3 Design & Technology students with the necessary skills such as lathing and drilling as well as a variety of handling skills so that they can grow to be independent when they are working on their 'O' & 'N' Level National Examinations. The students are also equipped with the necessary content knowledge at a greater degree such that they are able to understand and be aware of the rigor of journal work. 

 Students also given the opportunity to extend their learning at the tertiary level as the school has established a strong partnership with Singapore Polytechnic (School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering). In Advanced Elective Module (Electronic Design & Development), students will also collaborate and work in teams to undertake mini-projects designed to reinforce their basic knowledge of electronics.
 
 **Secondary 4/5(Design Quotient)** <br>
Having undergone a rigorous and authentic curriculum for 3 years, graduating students will be challenged to stretch their 21st century competencies such critical thinking, creativity as well as analytic skills to the next level as they embark on their final year project. The students will largely work independently on their coursework with close guidance from the teachers.

**<u>Food & Consumer Education:</u>**

**Overview of the FCE Curriculum**<br>
Food & Consumer Education (FCE) curriculum serves to increase the student's awareness on how diet can affect the health of a person. It empowers the students to be health-conscious and discerning consumers, so that they could better manage their lives for the present and future.

**Secondary 1 (Chef@Home)**<br>
Secondary One students will learn the basic cooking/cutting skills and knowledge of nutrition to make healthy yet interesting dishes for a person with a diet related disease. Students will be introduced to the use of simple 'toys' in cooking in the curriculum innovation of TOTT (Toys of The Trade). For example, they will be working with Dumpling maker machine (Dumpling Noodle), Pasta machine (Spaghetti Bolognese), and Sushi maker (Maki Sushi). In addition, students will learn culinary skills, cooking methods and food presentation as well as understand that good eating habits can prevent diet related diseases. Students will create a digital portfolio online to showcase their works and learn collaboratively.

**Secondary 2 (Chef @Work)**<br>
Secondary Two students will learn how to modify and create healthier dishes through the substitution of ingredients, based on dishes sold in the school canteen. Students also learn to work collaboratively and apply their prior knowledge in FCE to create interesting dishes.  Besides, students will be introduced to the importance of making healthy food choices when eating out (Healthy Lifestyle Habits) and appreciate the uniquely Singaporean flavour and taste of ethnic food.

**<u>MUSIC:</u>**

**Overview of the Music Curriculum**<br>
Music curriculum serves to increase the students’ awareness of and appreciation for music of various cultures and the role of music in daily living. It develop the students’ ability for creative expression and communication through music, and provide the basis to develop an informed and life-long involvement in music. We believe that every student has the opportunity and ability to appreciate music through musical experiences and to apply their experiences by contributing to the community/society.

**Secondary 1 (Face the Music)**<br>
Secondary One students will be introduced to the basic musical elements and concepts. In class, they learn to work collaboratively to create and perform using musical instruments, made from recycled materials. Besides, students will play music using drumsticks, and boomwhackers.


**Secondary 2 (Music in Community)**<br>
Secondary Two students will learn to appreciate the local and global music cultures using the Musically Singapore Apps. They are exposed to music technology through the use of IPads. They learn to work collaboratively to compose and perform their own song to promote environmental awareness (Theme: Earth Day).
