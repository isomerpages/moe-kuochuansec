All students undergo an authentic and rigorous curriculum and assessment through self-directed and collaborative learning in project works as well as School Curriculum Innovations (SCI).

Throughout the 4/5 years of learning, the students are also constantly and pervasively exposed to the use of ICT as well as the honing of their 21st century competencies as they embark in their projects and assessments.
