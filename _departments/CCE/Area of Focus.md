    <td>The Total Curriculum refers to all learning experiences planned in both the Curriculum and Co-curriculum, for the purpose of providing a holistic education which nurtures a balanced development across the moral, cognitive, social-emotional and physical domains. At the core, the Total Curriculum ensures that all basic values, knowledge and skills are taught to students to achieve the 8 learning outcomes of CCE. At the next level, the enablers of People, Process, Pedagogy, Programme and Partners play a critical role of translating the knowledge learnt into applied experiences thereby strengthening the school’s culture of Care, Collaboration and Excellence. This culture nurtures the student’s development of the desired values and skills such as 21st Century and Social and Emotional Competencies. With a strengthened culture in place, supported by the knowledge, skills and values, KCPians will be poised to achieve the desired outcomes of education.</td>
