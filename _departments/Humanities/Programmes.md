Our Secondary One students embarked on a learning journey to the Singapore River with the theme, “From a sleepy fishing village into a&nbsp;modern metropolis”. Through this they were able to gather information and data for their ‘Historical Investigation’ in a fun and engaging way based on an amazing race format. In addition, they were also able to apply Maths concepts and EL elements to challenges set to them in their learning journey.

History came alive for the Secondary Two students when they returned to the Japanese Occupation at the Memories at Old Ford Factory! A World War II historical site, the History and English department leveraged on the Secondary Two Learning Journey to walk through the pathway of ‘Syonan’ and relived the moments of the past. Many of our students walked away with a better understanding of the experiences of the locals and survivors of the Japanese Occupation, helping our young to appreciate that Singapore’s sovereignty came with a price.

"I enjoyed the learning journey as it led me to empathize with the locals during the Japanese Occupation.”

"I am actually standing in the same place Singapore officially surrendered to the Japanese!"

**Learning Journeys for Secondary Three students (Social Studies)**

The Secondary Three students embarked on their ‘Issues Investigation’ project with a view to solving the concerns facing an ageing population.&nbsp;

**Lower Sec**&nbsp;**Historical Investigation (HI)**&nbsp;**and Sec 4 Media Literacy Task**

The Secondary 2 and 4 History students were tasked to create a video using research findings gathered from their History lessons.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  

The Secondary 2s focussed on the Historical Investigation (HI) and created a video based on their understanding about the legacy of the Founding Fathers they have chosen to study while the Secondary 4s worked on the reasons for the Cold War.&nbsp;&nbsp;

  

Using iMovie, Windows Movie Maker and other video-making web applications, this project encourages an engaging pedagogy to make learning fun and exciting. Through their decision-making processes, in terms of the creation of their own messages and the mode of portrayal in their clips, this project promotes a deeper awareness of how history can come alive how they are able to evaluate significance in the past and how they impact the present and even the future.
