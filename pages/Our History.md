<h3><strong>HISTORY</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Genesis: Lighting a Flame for God and Truth</strong>
</p>
<p>In 1924, with the guidance of two devout Presbyterian ministers, Reverend
Tay Sek Tin and Reverend Tan Leng Tian, Katong Girls’ School was established
as a beacon of Christian faith in 1 Joo Chiat Terrace. The school was founded
with the dual purpose of imparting the teachings of Christianity and nurturing
young minds. By the end of the year, Katong Girls’ School grew from 11
to 300 students, as the school embraced co-education and diversity, offering
a rich tapestry of quality education and spiritual nurturing to individuals
from every background.</p>

<p><strong>Relocation to Koon Seng Road </strong>
</p>
<p>Because of divine providence, the Presbytery approved the construction
of a new school building at 47 Koon Seng Road. In 1925, the school relocated
and was renamed Choon Guan School in recognition of a generous donation
given to the school building fund by Dr Lee Choon Guan’s son.</p>
<p>Miss Margaret Dryburgh arrived in Singapore as an educational missionary
of the Presbyterian Church. She was first appointed as principal of Choon
Guan School in 1934, and saw through its transformation into Choon Guan
English School in 1936. When a separate girls’ school, Kuo Chuan Girls’
School was created in 1938, Miss Dryburgh became its first principal.</p>
<p>Mr John Rhys Richardson was first appointed the principal of Choon Guan
English</p>
<p>School when the school became a government-aided school for boys in 1938.
Mr Richardson was highly pivotal and influential during the early developing
years of Choon Guan English School, which was eventually renamed Presbyterian
Boys’ School.</p>

<p><strong>Hopefulness in the Dark Days (War)</strong>
</p>
<p>The two schools reached another important milestone when in 1985 they
were amalgamated into one co-educational full school called Kuo Chuan Presbyterian
Secondary School. As the school buildings and facilities had become increasingly
inadequate, the next year, the Ministry of Education allocated a new site
at Bishan Street 13 to the school. In 1987, the full school developed into
two schools, named Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School, headed by Mrs
Goh Soo Sim, and Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School, which continued
to be headed by Madam Kang. The Primary School moved to its present site
in November 1987 while the secondary school was relocated in June the next
year. In January 1991, Mr Low Eng Kee succeeded Madam Kang as principal.</p>
<p>Today the school stands witness to the spirit of our pioneers who, at
that time, saw education as a mission field. We give thanks to the Lord
for His undying faithfulness and provision throughout the years and for
this we give the Glory to God.</p>
