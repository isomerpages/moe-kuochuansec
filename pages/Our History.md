<h3><strong>HISTORY</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Genesis: Lighting a Flame for God and Truth</strong>
</p>
<p>In 1924, with the guidance of two devout Presbyterian ministers, Reverend
Tay Sek Tin and Reverend Tan Leng Tian, Katong Girls’ School was established
as a beacon of Christian faith in 1 Joo Chiat Terrace. The school was founded
with the dual purpose of imparting the teachings of Christianity and nurturing
young minds. By the end of the year, Katong Girls’ School grew from 11
to 300 students, as the school embraced co-education and diversity, offering
a rich tapestry of quality education and spiritual nurturing to individuals
from every background.</p>

<p><strong>Relocation to Koon Seng Road</strong>
</p>
<p>Because of divine providence, the Presbytery approved the construction
of a new school building at 47 Koon Seng Road. In 1925, the school relocated
and was renamed Choon Guan School in recognition of a generous donation
given to the school building fund by Dr Lee Choon Guan’s son.</p>
<p>Miss Margaret Dryburgh arrived in Singapore as an educational missionary
of the Presbyterian Church. She was first appointed as principal of Choon
Guan School in 1934, and saw through its transformation into Choon Guan
English School in 1936. When a separate girls’ school, Kuo Chuan Girls’
School was created in 1938, Miss Dryburgh became its first principal.</p>
<p>Mr John Rhys Richardson was first appointed the principal of Choon Guan
English</p>
<p>School when the school became a government-aided school for boys in 1938.
Mr Richardson was highly pivotal and influential during the early developing
years of Choon Guan English School, which was eventually renamed Presbyterian
Boys’ School.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Hopefulness in the Dark Days (War)</strong>
</p>
<p>With the onset of war in 1942, Kuo Chuan Girls’ School was severely damaged
by bombs and ceased operations during the Japanese Occupation (1942-1945).
These times were probably the darkest days of the school’s history.</p>
<p>In a parallel tale of faithfulness, Choon Guan English School underwent
transformation under the Japanese occupation, reopening later in 1950 as
Presbyterian Boys’ School, a testament to the enduring work of God.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of World War II and the Japanese occupation, a resilient
group of former staff members emerged with a singular determination: to
resurrect both schools from the ruins of conflict. Their undying trust
in God’s faithfulness fueled a sense of purpose and illuminated the way
forward as the schools rose from the ashes of war. In February 1947, Kuo
Chuan Girls’ School reopened its doors with Miss Monica Sirkett at the
helm.</p>

<p>In the divine narrative of Kuo Chuan Girls’ School, the passing of the
torch from Miss Monica Sirkett to Mrs Lee Choon Neo in 1972 symbolised
the continuation of God’s appointed stewardship. As the school expanded
its reach from Primary One to Standard Nine, it echoed the parable of the
mustard seed, growing from humble beginnings into a mighty tree, sheltering
all who sought its shade.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mr J.R. Richardson also emerged as a faithful steward entrusted with the
task of restoration of Choon Guan English School after World War II. In
1949, when the first senior batch of students faced the Cambridge School
Cambridge Certificate Examination, it was akin to seeds planted in fertile
soil, nurtured by the divine hand of providence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The renaming of the school as Presbyterian Boys’ School in 1950 symbolised
a rebirth, a demonstration of God’s abundant grace and guidance in times
of transition. In 1970, the introduction of a school anthem served as a
hymn of gratitude, a celebration of God’s blessings and the collective
identity forged among students and staff.</p>

<p><strong>Evolution of a Legacy: Towards a Unified Identity (1972 - 1987)</strong>
</p>

<p>Kuo Chuan Girls' School and Presbyterian Boys' School emerged as twin
branches of a sturdy tree, each rooted in a rich legacy of education and
a steadfast commitment to mission. In 1985, the two schools merged into
a singular entity known as Kuo Chuan Presbyterian School. The school’s
identity remained steadfast and unified, a beacon of Christian values and
holistic education.</p>
<p><strong>God’s Faithfulness through All Generations</strong>
</p>
<p>In 1987, KCPS was reorganised into Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary and
Secondary Schools, and continued to flourish under the guidance of dedicated
school leaders and educators. With Living Praise Presbyterian Church and
Adam Road Presbyterian Church serving as resident anchor churches, both
schools continued to grow and evolve against a backdrop of significant
educational initiatives. Strong connections were forged with the community,
and efforts to improve school infrastructure and curriculum have resulted
in sustainable and distinctive experiences for all students.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As KCPS celebrates her Centennial year in 2024, she remains Rooted in
Faith, Enduring for Good (cf. Galatians 6:9). The revival of the House
system across both schools as part of the celebrations will strengthen
the bond between the schools, and provide momentum for efforts for KCPS
to be a beacon of light in the community, and a testament to the abundance
of God’s grace and enduring power to sustain and uplift.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To God be the glory!</p>
