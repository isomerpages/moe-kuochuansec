<h3><strong>HISTORY</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Genesis: Lighting a Flame for God and Truth</strong>
</p>
<p>In 1924, with the guidance of two devout Presbyterian ministers, Reverend
Tay Sek Tin and Reverend Tan Leng Tian, Katong Girls’ School was established
as a beacon of Christian faith in 1 Joo Chiat Terrace. The school was founded
with the dual purpose of imparting the teachings of Christianity and nurturing
young minds. By the end of the year, Katong Girls’ School grew from 11
to 300 students, as the school embraced co-education and diversity, offering
a rich tapestry of quality education and spiritual nurturing to individuals
from every background.</p>

<p>Progress was also being made in the girls' school. It became a full government-aided
school in 1951 and two years later, the first group of students sat for
the Cambridge Examination .In line with government policy, Dryburgh English
School was merged with Presbyterian Boys' School under Mr Sia Kah Hui who
served as principal from 1961 to 1963. Succeeding principals were Mr Wee
Choon Siang. Mr Poon Meng Seng, Mr Tan Choong Yan and two Acting Principals.</p>
<p>In 1970, the schools' sense of identity was given a boost with the adoption
of a school anthem. The words were derived from a competition among the
staff and students of Presbyterian Boys' School while Mr Samuel Ting Chu
San specially wrote the music.</p>
<p>In 1972, Miss Sirkett retired after twenty-five years of tireless, fruitful
and dedicated service. Succeeding Principals were Mrs Lee Choon Neo from
1972 to 1977, Mrs Mabel Lew from 1978 to 1983 and Madam Kang Swee Chin
from 1984 to 1990.</p>

<p>The two schools reached another important milestone when in 1985 they
were amalgamated into one co-educational full school called Kuo Chuan Presbyterian
Secondary School. As the school buildings and facilities had become increasingly
inadequate, the next year, the Ministry of Education allocated a new site
at Bishan Street 13 to the school. In 1987, the full school developed into
two schools, named Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School, headed by Mrs
Goh Soo Sim, and Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School, which continued
to be headed by Madam Kang. The Primary School moved to its present site
in November 1987 while the secondary school was relocated in June the next
year. In January 1991, Mr Low Eng Kee succeeded Madam Kang as principal.</p>
<p>Today the school stands witness to the spirit of our pioneers who, at
that time, saw education as a mission field. We give thanks to the Lord
for His undying faithfulness and provision throughout the years and for
this we give the Glory to God.</p>
