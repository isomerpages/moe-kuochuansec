<h3><strong>HISTORY</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Genesis: Lighting a Flame for God and Truth</strong>
</p>
<p>In 1924, with the guidance of two devout Presbyterian ministers, Reverend
Tay Sek Tin and Reverend Tan Leng Tian, Katong Girls’ School was established
as a beacon of Christian faith in 1 Joo Chiat Terrace. The school was founded
with the dual purpose of imparting the teachings of Christianity and nurturing
young minds. By the end of the year, Katong Girls’ School grew from 11
to 300 students, as the school embraced co-education and diversity, offering
a rich tapestry of quality education and spiritual nurturing to individuals
from every background.</p>

<p><strong>Relocation to Koon Seng Road</strong>
</p>
<p>Because of divine providence, the Presbytery approved the construction
of a new school building at 47 Koon Seng Road. In 1925, the school relocated
and was renamed Choon Guan School in recognition of a generous donation
given to the school building fund by Dr Lee Choon Guan’s son.</p>
<p>Miss Margaret Dryburgh arrived in Singapore as an educational missionary
of the Presbyterian Church. She was first appointed as principal of Choon
Guan School in 1934, and saw through its transformation into Choon Guan
English School in 1936. When a separate girls’ school, Kuo Chuan Girls’
School was created in 1938, Miss Dryburgh became its first principal.</p>
<p>Mr John Rhys Richardson was first appointed the principal of Choon Guan
English</p>
<p>School when the school became a government-aided school for boys in 1938.
Mr Richardson was highly pivotal and influential during the early developing
years of Choon Guan English School, which was eventually renamed Presbyterian
Boys’ School.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Hopefulness in the Dark Days (War)</strong>
</p>
<p>With the onset of war in 1942, Kuo Chuan Girls’ School was severely damaged
by bombs and ceased operations during the Japanese Occupation (1942-1945).
These times were probably the darkest days of the school’s history.</p>
<p>In a parallel tale of faithfulness, Choon Guan English School underwent
transformation under the Japanese occupation, reopening later in 1950 as
Presbyterian Boys’ School, a testament to the enduring work of God.</p>

<p>In the aftermath of World War II and the Japanese occupation, a resilient
group of former staff members emerged with a singular determination: to
resurrect both schools from the ruins of conflict. Their undying trust
in God’s faithfulness fueled a sense of purpose and illuminated the way
forward as the schools rose from the ashes of war. In February 1947, Kuo
Chuan Girls’ School reopened its doors with Miss Monica Sirkett at the
helm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the divine narrative of Kuo Chuan Girls’ School, the passing of the
torch from Miss Monica Sirkett to Mrs Lee Choon Neo in 1972 symbolised
the continuation of God’s appointed stewardship. As the school expanded
its reach from Primary One to Standard Nine, it echoed the parable of the
mustard seed, growing from humble beginnings into a mighty tree, sheltering
all who sought its shade.</p>
