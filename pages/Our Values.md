     style="width:75%">


**God-fearing**  
We believe in the Creator God who watches over us and guides our every action, thought and speech - integrity, humility, love and respect for others - through a reverential relationship with God.  
  
"Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength." - Mark 12:30

  

**Resilience**  
We believe that in the fast and changing would of tomorrow, having the ability to recover from setbacks and failures and the steady persistence in adhering to a purpose will put KCPians in good stead..  
  
"I pressed on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus." - Philippians 3:14

  

**Agape**  
We believe that at the very heart of biblical teaching, it is God's unconditional love for mankind that surpasses, and embraces all things. God's unconditional love was demonstrated to us through Christ's death on the cross. Roman 5:8 says, "While we were still sinners, Christ died for us." In response, we must always act out of love to fellow men, showing genuine and unselfish concern for others.  
  
":And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love." 1 Corinthians 13:13  
NB: Agape is a Greek word for unconditional love of God.

  

**Conscientiousness**  
We want to raise diligent and persevering individuals in order to achieve success.  
  
"I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith." 2 Timothy 4:7

  

**Empathy**  
We believe that just as God is compassionate, we need to have the capacity to identify with, be sensitive and respond to one another"s situation, feelings and motives. "Be kind and compassionate to one another, forgive each other, just as in Christ God forgave you." Ephesians 4:32
