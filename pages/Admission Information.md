### Affiliation Information

Affiliated School:   ST. Andrew’s Junior College, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School

Students who wished to be posted to an affiliated secondary school via affiliation priority must indicate the affiliated secondary school as the first choice. However, this affiliation priority does not guarantee admission, as admission is subject to the availability of places.

It is important for all secondary schools to remain accessible to students regardless of their background and connections. Hence, at least 20% of the places in each course (i.e. Express/N(A)/N(T)) of each school, will be allocated to those who do not benefit from the affiliation priority.
