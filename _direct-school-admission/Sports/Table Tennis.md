<h4>Introduction &amp; Background</h4>
<p>As members of KCPSS Table Tennis CCA, aspiring students can look forward
to a holistic training programme that not only hones their skills and techniques
to be highly competent players of the sport, but also develops their leadership
potential to be effective Servant Leaders who can inspire a common vision
for their peers.</p>
<p>With the strong support and care our CCA members receive from our nurturing
teachers and coaches, they will emerge as disciplined and confident Table
Tennis players. In addition to that, the leadership qualities they develop
with us will serve them well beyond their secondary school years to become
resilient individuals and supportive team players. Our training programme
has also empowered our Table Tennis teams to achieve positive results at
competitions.</p>
<p>Students can expect a positive and encouraging learning environment, with
plenty of opportunities to spar with players of various competencies and
expertise. They will also receive ample exposure to competitive experiences
through friendly matches with other schools, on top of our annual NSG competitions.
Students who are keen to pursue Table Tennis professionally will also be
given further opportunities to develop their talent.</p>
