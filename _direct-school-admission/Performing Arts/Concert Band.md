<h4>Introduction &amp; Background</h4>
<p>At KCPSS Band, we aim to develop every Band member into musicians who
play music to inspire, and who continue to appreciate music after graduation.
Through a variety of experiences (e.g. camps, public and school performances),
we provide opportunities for members to hone not just their musical skills,
but also leadership skills. Besides learning to play an instrument, members
would have developed other valuable skills such as sight reading, playing
music by ear, and coordinating with others in making music together.</p>
<p>We welcome passionate, talented and committed individuals who want to
join the KCPSS Band to make music that moves and inspires!</p>
