### Introduction &amp; Background


The KCPSS Choir values are: Aspire, Perseverance and Teamwork.

We aim to provide a holistic education through Choir to develop music literacy, interest and skills in singing as well as to develop performance excellence, to build character, team spirit, leadership skills and confidence.

The choir training programme focuses on voice projection, breathing techniques, aural training, sight singing, music theory and simple choreography.
