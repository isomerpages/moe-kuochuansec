<h4>Introduction &amp; Background</h4>
<p>KCPSS Dance CCA offers a holistic pathway for aspiring students to be
nurtured as a Servant Leader, then a technically proficient dancer.</p>
<p>By providing a caring, nurturing environment, KCPSS Dance seeks to inculcate
a spirit of personal mastery and personal discipline in every dancer within
the ensemble. These values has enabled the CCA to possess a long-standing
history of reaching high levels of performance results with mostly Distinctions
and Accomplishments for their SYF Presentations.</p>
<p>Additionally Dance CCA has had the honor of performing for multiple distinguished
guests like President Dr Tony Tan and Madam Halimah and showcased their
talents to the community and school alumni as well.</p>
<p>By joining us, students can look forward to a conducive and nurturing
environment with high engagement in, achievement through and enjoyment
of learning in both their academic field as well as their area of Dance
interest.</p>
<p>Students can look forward to multiple performance opportunities in various
concerts, special celebratory occasions and even Dance Music Videos. During
their time in KCPSS, they will minimally be included in one biannual Singapore
Youth Festival Arts Presentation. Dancers will learn the value of teamwork
and Servant Leadership with many graduates pursuing their interest in dance
in higher education.</p>
