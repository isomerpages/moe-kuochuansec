<h2>Introduction &amp; Background</h2>
<p>The KCPian servant leader is a unique individual. On top of being a leader
equipped with leadership skill sets to implement ideas and organise teams,
the KCPian servant leader is one who is able to&nbsp;<strong>empathise</strong>&nbsp;with
the needs of the community, effecting positive change through service.</p>
<p>The servant leader has a heart for the people around them and the concerns
that they face; possessing the moral courage to translate these concerns
into impactful actions for the improvement of the community.</p>
<p>At KCPSS, we look to develop every KCPian into resilient and responsible
servant leaders to be change makers. We do so by putting in place an intentional
and structured&nbsp;<strong>equipping</strong>&nbsp;process to provide
opportunities for every KCPian to be developed with leadership skills and
competencies to effectively lead themselves and others. These include structured
leadership workshops and opportunities to lead in different platforms like
in our Student Leadership Board and CCA among others. These experiences
will in turn allow them to apply what they have learnt in authentic leadership
settings.</p>
<p>The school believes in the co-creation of a culture of care, collaboration
and excellence through efforts from both students and school â€“ thus students
are&nbsp;<strong>empowered</strong>&nbsp;to actively contribute to the
community through the ownership of projects and school improvement</p>
<p>Here, we are always on the lookout for purpose-driven, proactive and committed
individuals who exhibit leadership potential on top of good and consistent
character. If you fit the bill, come join us through the Direct Schools
Admission (DSA) exercise to allow us to know you better!</p>
