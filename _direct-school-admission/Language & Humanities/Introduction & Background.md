## Introduction & Background

Media literacy is an important 21st century approach to education where students access, analyse, evaluate, create and participate in a community using messages in a variety of forms – from print to non-print.

Since time spent consuming media is constantly on the rise, a typical KCPSS student operates in a media-saturated environment where they are equipped with critical thinking and analysis skills they need to successfully analyse and understand different media messages and formats. 

 The media literacy programme at KCPSS is designed to develop in students a nuanced thinking about media messages, as well as to be effective message creators with an awareness of their goals and values so that they become responsible consumers and producers of media as well as effective participants in the media world.

Media literacy builds an understanding of the role of media in society as well as essential skills of inquiry and self-expression necessary for citizens of a democracy.

The school believes in developing skills for students to be competent, critical and literate in all media forms so that they are equipped to

●       Control the interpretation of what they see, hear or interact with

●       Express views/communicate messages using a range of media forms

●       Raise the right questions about what they watch, read, listen or contribute to

  

Apart from media literacy, shortlisted applicants will also get the opportunity to be part of the school’s very own Spin Doctors Programme, where students are taught skills ranging from writing, journalism to even hosting programmes! They will also be given platforms to showcase these skills, such as taking part in competitions or emceeing school programmes.
