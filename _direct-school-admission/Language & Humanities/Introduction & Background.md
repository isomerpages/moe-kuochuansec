<h2>Introduction &amp; Background</h2>
<p>Media literacy is an important 21st&nbsp;century approach to education
where students access, analyse, evaluate, create and participate in a community
using messages in a variety of forms – from print to non-print.</p>
<p>Since time spent consuming media is constantly on the rise, a typical&nbsp;KCPSS&nbsp;student
operates in a media-saturated environment where they are equipped with
critical thinking and analysis skills they need to successfully analyse
and understand different media messages and formats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The media literacy programme at KCPSS is designed to develop in
students a nuanced thinking about media messages, as well as to be effective
message creators with an awareness of their goals and values so that they
become&nbsp;responsible consumers and producers of media as well as effective
participants in the media world.</p>
<p>Media literacy builds an understanding of the role of media in society
as well as essential skills of inquiry and self-expression necessary for
citizens of a democracy.</p>
<p>The school believes in developing skills for students to be competent,
critical and literate in all media forms so that they are equipped to</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Control the interpretation
of what they see, hear or interact with</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Express views/communicate messages
using a range of media forms</p>
<p>●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raise the right questions about
what they watch, read, listen or contribute to</p>
<p>Apart from media literacy, shortlisted applicants will also get the opportunity
to be part of the school’s very own Spin Doctors Programme, where students
are taught skills ranging from writing, journalism to even hosting programmes!
They will also be given platforms to showcase these skills, such as taking
part in competitions or emceeing school programmes.</p>
<p>We are looking for students who specialise in media literacy in three
areas - public speaking, journalism, and communications.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Public speaking: Public Speaking focuses primarily on the art of oral
presentation to live audiences. It demands mastery of verbal delivery,
body language, and audience engagement. Speakers will develop strong voice
projection, confident stage presence, and the ability to structure compelling
speeches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Journalism: Journalism centers on the gathering, verification, and presentation
of news and information. Journalists prioritize accurate reporting, thorough
research, and ethical storytelling. They conduct interviews, verify sources,
and develop stories that inform the public about current events and important
issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communications: Communications skills are imperative in digital media
content. Communications professionals must master both written and visual
communication, understand social media dynamics, and develop strategic
approaches to message delivery. They will work in diverse areas such as
corporate communications, public relations, and brand management, often
combining elements of both public speaking and journalistic skills in their
work.</p>
</li>
</ul>
