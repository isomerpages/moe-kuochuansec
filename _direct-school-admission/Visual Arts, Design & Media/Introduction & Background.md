## Introduction &amp; Background

The KCPSS Visual Art Programme is supported by the efforts of two of our exciting CCAs: Infocomm Technology and Photography.

Choosing to pursue a DSA programme in Visual Art with us will give students access to professional trainers who will help them develop their skills in media and film production, as well as a wide array of photography areas.

**<u>Media Art and Film (Under Infocomm Technology CCA)</u>**

At the end of the 4-5 years in our M.E.D.I.A Programme, your students will be able to

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**M**aster core skills through an engaging and structured curriculum of media production

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**E**quip themselves with knowledge in the use of visual media so that they can creatively communicate ideas through film

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**D**evelop relevant story ideas that can serve a real-life purpose

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**I**llustrate story ideas through storyboarding.

●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**A**pply skills learnt to create media that support the school and the community

In addition, students will be able to pick up other soft skills such as teamwork and time management, and be given platforms like major school events and school social media to showcase their work.

**<u>Photography (Under Photography CCA)</u>**

Under professional guidance, students in our programme will be able to develop themselves in a variety of photography styles ranging from event to abstract photography. Students will also develop and understand their own creative process and potential as well as a keen eye for visual hierarchy. Through building their own personal portfolio, students will also understand how to create focus and emphasis through storytelling and expression.

Apart from a progressive programme, students are constantly challenged to apply their learnt techniques in real life applications like in the support of school events. Their works may be featured in school publications like our Espoir magazine as well as on school social media platforms. Their skills will also be put to the test through participation in competitions like the Canon Photomarathon, Singapore Young Photographers’ Convention and the Our Schools Our Stories photo competition.

Through this programme, students will be part of a vibrant CCA culture which places emphasis on self and peer leadership, and which nurtures independence, creativity and collaborative learning.

Do apply now to develop your skills in Visual Art and be part of our exciting KCPSS experience!
