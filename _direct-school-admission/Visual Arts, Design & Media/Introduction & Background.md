<p><strong>Photography (Under Photography CCA)</strong>
</p>
<p>Under guidance, students in our programme will be able to develop themselves
in a variety of photography styles ranging from event to abstract photography.
Students will also develop and understand their own creative process and
potential as well as a keen eye for visual hierarchy. Through building
their own personal portfolio, students will also understand how to create
focus and emphasis through storytelling and expression.</p>
<p>Apart from a progressive programme, students are constantly challenged
to apply their learnt techniques in real life applications like in the
support of school events. Their works may be featured in school publications
like our Espoir magazine as well as on school social media platforms. Their
skills will also be put to the test through participation in competitions
like the Canon Photomarathon, Singapore Young Photographers’ Convention
and the Our Schools Our Stories photo competition.</p>
<p>Through this programme, students will be part of a vibrant CCA culture
which places emphasis on self and peer leadership, and which nurtures independence,
creativity and collaborative learning.</p>
