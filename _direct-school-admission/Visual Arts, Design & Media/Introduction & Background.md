<p>Under professional guidance, students in our programme will be able to
develop themselves in a variety of photography styles ranging from event
to abstract photography. Students will also develop and understand their
own creative process and potential as well as a keen eye for visual hierarchy.
Through building their own personal portfolio, students will also understand
how to create focus and emphasis through storytelling and expression.</p>
<p>Apart from a progressive programme, students are constantly challenged
to apply their learnt techniques in real life applications like in the
support of school events. Their works may be featured in school publications
like our Espoir magazine as well as on school social media platforms. Their
skills will also be put to the test through participation in competitions
like the Canon Photomarathon, Singapore Young Photographersâ€™ Convention
and the Our Schools Our Stories photo competition.</p>
<p>Through this programme, students will be part of a vibrant CCA culture
which places emphasis on self and peer leadership, and which nurtures independence,
creativity and collaborative learning.</p>
