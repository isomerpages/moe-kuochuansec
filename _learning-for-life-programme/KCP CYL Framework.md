## KCP CYL Framework


**KCP CYL Framework**

<p align="justify">Leadership is defined as the extent of impact and influence an individual makes regardless of his position or authority. The growth journey of a KCPian Servant Leader starts with the development of the leadership of self and is responsible and caring contribution to others. This is the baseline leadership that sets the groundwork for the growth of KCPians to grow to be servant leaders in their lifetime.

The framework unpacks the characteristics and competencies of the KCPian servant leader as he moves along this growth journey. Each leadership milestone is also mapped against the corresponding social and emotional competencies we hope to develop at each stage of their leadership journey.
