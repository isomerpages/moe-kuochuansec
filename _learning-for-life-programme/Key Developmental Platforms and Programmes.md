  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: justify">It aims to develop empathy in the KCPSS servantleader through involvement and initiating changes in the community. We believe this learning experience can enhance student development as students grow to be socially responsible citizens through active ownership of their VIA projects. <br>Students discover through action and research what they care about and reflect on social issues and community concerns. Through time, it becomes a disposition for students to want to effect positive change in the community. Form teachers are key in facilitating discussions and drawing deep learning points. This is done through the approach of AAA – Awareness, Action and Advocacy. It starts with raising students’ awareness on specific social issues of concern in the community and actions that they can take. <br>The students are given the opportunity to be on site to have an hands-on experience to gain perspective on the needs of the community and to devise a plan to improve a situation that they care about and finally, they are given platforms to advocate the causes they want to champion through inspiring and influencing others to make a difference to issues of concern.</td>

  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: justify">Youth Day Celebrations (YDC) is one of our key events in KCPSS. To encourage greater ownership, student leaders under the Student Leadership Board organise and plan this event where they work closely with class monitors under the mentorship of the teachers. In a vibrant and carnival-like atmosphere, YDC provides a platform to not only showcase the community service efforts for the year by each class, it also serves as a channel of advocacy for causes that students have identified and been working on throughout the year. The key message of empowering youth and student initiated efforts to reach out and make a difference to the community is reflected in its yearly theme of “Let Your Light Shine!” During this event, students get to set up social enterprises to raise funds through games booths, sales of food and beverages, products and services and organising concerts.</td>

    <th colspan="1"> C. KCPSS Orientation Week and Level Camps  </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="text-align: justify"> The Orientation Week for Secondary Ones as well as Level Camps for Secondary Two and Three students aim to develop students in self and servant leadership, inculcate G.R.A.C.E values and emerging 21CC skills. The level camps incorporate the intentional design of activities to ensure engaging experiential based learning. There is also visibility of learning to ensure that facilitators are able to capture and make sense of defined behaviors and actions of students during the activities. Developmental feedback is given to students through affirmation or specific areas for improvement to enable deeper learning. The active facilitation and feedback cycle put in place during the level camps help students concretise their learning and understand how to apply the leadership theories they have learned to real-world situations.</td>

    <th colspan="2">D. Structured Training Programme for Student Leaders</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="2" style="text-align: justify"> Beyond self-leadership modules set in place during cohort programmes, there are also structured training programmes for student leaders in the Student Leadership Board, CCAs, and other-positional leaders e.g. class monitors. <br><br><br>We want to create an empowering culture especially among the student leaders and set in place platforms for them to experience success through service to school. For example, twice-yearly student leadership camps (SLC) are organised for students in the Student Leadership Board with this focus in mind. Each student leader goes through a progressive training cycle with each SLC they attend, ranging from organisational to communication skills. <br><br>Through each cycle of training, students discover their strengths and opportunities for growth to work better together with peers. They are given opportunities to lead and plan events like Secondary 1 Orientation Week and Youth Day Celebrations. Such platforms allow them to gain confidence and experience in their leadership journey. Other opportunities include being ambassadors during our school’s Open House or getting to share expertise and experiences with other schools’ student leaders at combined camps like the Ngee Ann Poly Youth Leaders’ Camp.</td>
