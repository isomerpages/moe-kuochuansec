<p><strong>MOTHER TONGUE DEPARTMENT</strong>
</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Area of Focus</h2>
<p>The Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School Mother Tongue (MT) Department
aims to enthuse and develop students to become&nbsp;active learners and
proficient MTL users so that they are able to use MTL to engage in effective
communications in real life settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through the learning of MTL, the department also seeks to cultivate in
students an appreciation of the cultural values and traditions&nbsp;associated
with each MTL in our society.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Mother Tongue Department Pedagogical Approach</strong>

<p>The Mother Tongue Department pedagogy is anchored on three pillars - Metacognition,
Artificial Intelligence (AI), and E-Pedagogy - which work together to deepen
learning and enhance student engagement. Through these approaches, we nurture
confident, self-directed, and proficient communicators.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>1. Metacognition — Learning How to Think</strong>
</p>
<p>Through cultivating metacognitive practices in Oral and Listening Comprehension,
students learn to be aware of their own thought processes when approaching
questions. They are guided to plan, monitor, and evaluate their understanding,
enabling them to become more reflective and independent learners.</p>
<p><strong>2. Artificial Intelligence (AI) — Personalised and Timely Feedback</strong>
</p>
<p>We incorporate AI tools such as the Short Answer Feedback System, Speech
Evaluation Platforms, and SALIS in our exam preparation and classroom practices.
These systems offer instant, individualised feedback and targeted guidance
to help students refine their responses and enhance overall language proficiency.</p>
<p><strong>3. E-pedagogy — Learning beyond the classroom</strong>
<br>Through digital platforms such as the Student Learning Space (SLS), students
engage in interactive and collaborative activities that extend learning
beyond the classroom. E-Pedagogy enables flexible, self-directed learning
while enhancing engagement and ownership of the language learning process.</p>
