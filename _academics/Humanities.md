<p>Our Secondary One students embarked on a learning journey to the Singapore
River with the theme, “From a sleepy fishing village into a modern metropolis”.
Through this they were able to gather information and data for their ‘Historical
Investigation’ in a fun and engaging way based on an amazing race format.
In addition, they were also able to apply Maths concepts and EL elements
to challenges set to them in their learning journey.</p>

<p>Our Secondary Two students were tasked with conducting a Historical Investigation
into the topic of Merger and Separation. Students analysed historical sources,
then created an end product based on their understanding of the reasons
why Singapore merged with or separated from Malaya. Through this experience,
our students saw how history can come alive as they are able to evaluate
the significance of the past and its impact on the present and even the
future.</p>
