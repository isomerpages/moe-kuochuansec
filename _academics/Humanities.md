<p>Our Secondary One students embarked on a learning journey to the Singapore
River with the theme, “From a sleepy fishing village into a modern metropolis”.
Through this they were able to gather information and data for their ‘Historical
Investigation’ in a fun and engaging way based on an amazing race format.
In addition, they were also able to apply Maths concepts and EL elements
to challenges set to them in their learning journey.</p>

<p>History came alive for the Secondary Two students when they returned to
the Japanese Occupation at the Former Ford Factory Museum! A World War
II historical site, the History and English department leveraged on the
Secondary Two Learning Journey to walk through the pathway of ‘Syonan’
and relived the moments of the past. Many of our students walked away with
a better understanding of the experiences of the locals and survivors of
the Japanese Occupation, helping our young to appreciate that Singapore’s
sovereignty came with a price.</p>

<p>Our Secondary Two students were tasked with conducting a Historical Investigation
into the topic of Merger and Separation. Students analysed historical sources,
then created an end product based on their understanding of the reasons

our students saw how history can come alive as they are able to evaluate
the significance of the past and its impact on the present and even the
