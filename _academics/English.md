<h3>Programmes</h3>
<p>The Department of English and Literature offers a variety of language-enriched
literary programmes to pique students’ passion for English and Literature
respectively. The Department recognises the diverse learning abilities
of students, and therefore places strong emphasis in programmes which are&nbsp;**differentiated**&nbsp;to
the needs of these groups.</p>

<p>The Secondary One students embark on recording a podcast as an Alternative
Assessment over a few weeks. Students become confident speakers, taking
ownership of their learning. Podcasting serves as a platform for each student
to vocalise their thoughts.</p>
<p>Before students start recording, scaffolds are usually put in place to
enable learning and for them to perform to the best of their abilities.
Students are taught reading aloud oral communication skills. They also
learn about the structure of writing a speech followed by carrying out
process writing of the speech. Students will have hands-on experience with
the recorder application in the iPad to record their podcast. Finally,
as the finishing touch, students will edit their podcast and add the finishing
touches i.e. background music to their podcast.</p>

<p>Does Romeo and Juliet need an introduction? With its strong emotional
impact, the play has remained popular since it was first staged in the
mid 1590s. What could be more moving than the story of two adolescents
finding in their sudden love for each other a reason to defy their families’
mutual hatred by marrying secretly? The tragic outcome of their blameless
love (their “misadventured piteous overthrows”) seems equally easy to understand:
it results first from Tybalt’s hotheaded refusal to obey the Prince’s command
and second from accidents of timing beyond any human ability to foresee
or control. Simple in its storyline, clear in its affirmation of the power
of love over hate,<em> Romeo and Juliet </em>seems to provide both a timeless
theme and universal appeal with its obvious relevance to the emotional
and social concerns of young people.</p>
<p>Join us and explore this timeless classic which examines the themes of
youth, love, and fate.</p>
<p><strong>“It’s Lit” Literature Card Game</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Eliciting Literary Discourse and Active Learning Through Game-based Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>The Literature team shared with fellow Literature educators at the Teacher-led
workshop hosted by the Academy of Singapore Teachers in 2021 on the department’s
first ever game-based learning strategies enacted in the English Literature
classroom to elicit literary discourse and encourage active learning. An
innovative approach to teaching literary discourse via an innovative card
game was mooted by the Literature team which aims to encourage self-directed
learning as well as cooperative learning. This enabled the team to explore
the use of game-play to engage learners in an exploratory and collaborative
study of poetry to enhance students’ engagement, appreciation and understanding
in the Literature classroom.</p>
