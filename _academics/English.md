<p><strong>“It’s Lit” Literature Card Game</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Eliciting Literary Discourse and Active Learning Through Game-based Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>The Literature team shared with fellow Literature educators at the Teacher-led
workshop hosted by the Academy of Singapore Teachers in 2021 on the department’s
first ever game-based learning strategies enacted in the English Literature
classroom to elicit literary discourse and encourage active learning. An
innovative approach to teaching literary discourse via an innovative card
game was mooted by the Literature team which aims to encourage self-directed
learning as well as cooperative learning. This enabled the team to explore
the use of game-play to engage learners in an exploratory and collaborative
study of poetry to enhance students’ engagement, appreciation and understanding
in the Literature classroom.</p>
