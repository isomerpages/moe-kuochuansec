<p><strong>Our Support Programme ; English Language First</strong>
</p>
<p>The English Language First is a support programme for selected Lower Secondary
students to provide the necessary learning support for students to bridge
their learning gaps in the English Language. To ensure early intervention,
diagnostic tests are administered at the start of Secondary One&nbsp; to
ascertain the language proficiency of every student. Students who require
more support would then be identified for the English Language First programme,
to help them establish the fundamental understanding of the language at
an early stage. Some of the areas of focus of the English Language First
programmes are:</p>

<p><strong>“It’s Lit” Literature Card Game</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Eliciting Literary Discourse and Active Learning Through Game-based Learning</strong>
</p>
<p>The Literature team shared with fellow Literature educators at the Teacher-led
workshop hosted by the Academy of Singapore Teachers in 2021 on the department’s
first ever game-based learning strategies enacted in the English Literature
classroom to elicit literary discourse and encourage active learning. An
innovative approach to teaching literary discourse via an innovative card
game was mooted by the Literature team which aims to encourage self-directed
learning as well as cooperative learning. This enabled the team to explore
the use of game-play to engage learners in an exploratory and collaborative
study of poetry to enhance students’ engagement, appreciation and understanding
in the Literature classroom.</p>
