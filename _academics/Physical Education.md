<p><strong>PE DEPARTMENT</strong>
</p>
<h2>Area of Focus</h2>
<p>It is the department's aim to nurture physically educated students who
will eventually go on to become life long physically active adults. We
believe that a healthy body will lead to a healthy mind which in turn will
support learning, growing and contributing back to society.</p>
<p>Hence the PE Department had adopted a two-pronged approach to encourage
students to adopt a healthy lifestyle. The two approaches include Curriculum
Program and Co-Curricular Platforms. In Curriculum, Sports and Games are
taught through a structured Modular Program during PE lessons.</p>
<p>In the Co-Curriculum, events such as inter-class games and School Cross
Country Championships bring the school cohort together to create a vibrant
sporting atmosphere. This helps to create peer influence among the students
to stay active. In addition the Secondary 1 and 3 MOE-OBS Challenge give
the department a chance to promote a love for learning and the outdoors
beyond the classroom.</p>
<h4><strong>PE Modular Programme</strong></h4>
<p>In our journey to build<strong> KCPians</strong> who lead physically active
lives, the PE Department seeks to infuse skills and concepts for various
sports and games. This helps <strong>KCPians</strong> gain recreational proficiency
in the following sports and games before they graduate. This will help
to provide a starting point for lifelong engagement in sports.</p>
<p>Student will learn the following sports and games in their 4/5 years of
education here in KCPSS</p>

<p>Assessment of the sports modules serve both as a feedback and summative
tool to help students improve on their sport.</p>
<p>Learning is further reinforced by the Inter-Class Games which acts as
a culmination of the learning gained from the various sports modules. Often,
these competitions become the highlight of many students' school life as
they always evoke enduring memories of friendship and class spirit.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Secondary 1 &amp; Secondary 3 Level Camps</strong>
</p>
<p>All <strong>KCPians</strong> will also have the opportunity to participate
in two Outdoor Adventure Camps in Sec 1 and 3. The Sec 1 Camp is held locally
with the objective of helping <strong>KCPians</strong> inculcate a sense
of Self Leadership and Awareness, as well as helping them bond with their
new classmates.</p>
<p>The Secondary 3 Camp is held as part of the Outward Bound School Programme.
It aims to stretch our students by taking them out of their comfort zone.
This helps them internalise the principles of Self and Group Leadership,
as well as an appreciation of nature through outdoor experiential learning.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Other Events</strong>
</p>
<p>KCPians can also look forward to a whole slew of exciting PE events like
our Inter-class Games, and Annual Cross Country Championships. All designed
to help KCPians stay active and healthy through their time with the school,
and to learn valuable lessons to help them continue to stay active beyond
school.</p>
