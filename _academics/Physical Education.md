<p>It is the department's aim to nurture physically educated students who
will eventually go on to become life long physically active adults. We
believe that a healthy body will lead to a healthy mind which in turn will
support learning, growing and contributing back to society.</p>
<p>Hence the PE Department had adopted a two-pronged approach to encourage
students to adopt a healthy lifestyle. The two approaches include Curriculum
Program and Co-Curricular Platforms. In Curriculum, Sports and Games are
taught through a structured Modular Program during PE lessons.</p>
<p>In the Co-Curriculum, events such as inter-class games and School Cross
Country Championships bring the school cohort together to create a vibrant
sporting atmosphere. This helps to create peer influence among the students
to stay active. In addition the Secondary 1 and 3 MOE-OBS Challenge give
the department a chance to promote a love for learning and the outdoors
beyond the classroom.</p>
<h4><strong>PE Modular Programme</strong></h4>
<p>In our journey to build<strong> KCPians</strong> who lead physically active
lives, the PE Department seeks to infuse skills and concepts for various
sports and games. This helps <strong>KCPians</strong> gain recreational proficiency
in the following sports and games before they graduate. This will help
to provide a starting point for lifelong engagement in sports.</p>
<p>Student will learn the following sports and games in their 4/5 years of
education here in KCPSS</p>
