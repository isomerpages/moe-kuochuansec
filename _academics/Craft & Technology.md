<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p>The Design &amp; Technology (D&amp;T) curriculum immerses students in
the progressive learning of design thinking, problem-solving, and technical
concepts across 4 to 5 years of secondary education. Through authentic
and rigorous projects, students engage in <strong>self-directed inquiry, collaborative design work, and School Curriculum Innovation (SCI)</strong>.</p>
<p>Throughout this journey, students are meaningfully exposed to <strong>adaptive thinking and critical thinking</strong> and
the continual development of <strong>21st Century Competencies (21CC)</strong>,
equipping them with creativity, resilience, and problem-solving skills
essential for their projects and assessments.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary 1 – Design Discovery</strong>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p>At Secondary 1, students embark on their <strong>first encounter with D&amp;T</strong>,
a subject unlike any they have taken before. The focus is on sparking curiosity
and introducing the <strong>world of design in daily life</strong>—from
simple phone holders to electronic tags.</p>
<p>Students gain awareness that design is not limited to exhibitions or buildings
but is all around them. They also develop foundational <strong>technical skills</strong> such
as drilling, filing, and sanding, which build their <strong>spatial awareness and confidence</strong> in
handling tools and materials.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary 2 – Design Community</strong>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p>In Secondary 2, students broaden their design perspectives by learning
to <strong>think and do</strong>—to visualise possibilities and transform
them into tangible design solutions for real-world contexts. They engage
with <strong>non-verbal design codes</strong> such as sketches, diagrams,
models, and prototypes, which help them translate <strong>abstract needs</strong> (e.g.,
creating intellectual engagement or designing for children) into <strong>concrete, purposeful objects</strong>.</p>
<p>Through this process, students develop a <strong>solution-focused mindset</strong>,
strengthening their ability to design and make with empathy, creativity,
and functionality in mind. This constructive approach not only deepens
their understanding of how design serves communities but also equips them
with the confidence to tackle open-ended, ill-defined problems.</p>

<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p><strong>Secondary 3 – Design Immersion</strong>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p>At this stage, students deepen their expertise through immersion in rigorous
design practices. Building on the foundations from Sec 1 and 2, they acquire
advanced skills such as lathe and complex drilling, while honing independence
in preparation for their N &amp; O-Level coursework.</p>
<p>Students are equipped with greater content knowledge and experience the
demands of structured journal work, enabling them to think critically and
document their design processes.</p>
<p>Through the school’s partnership with Singapore Polytechnic (School of
Electrical &amp; Electronic Engineering), students may also explore an
Advanced Elective Module (Electronic Design &amp; Development). Here, they
collaborate on mini-projects to reinforce their grasp of electronics and
strengthen teamwork in authentic design contexts.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary 4/5 – Design Quotient</strong>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td rowspan="1" colspan="3">
<p>In their graduating years, students draw on the skills and experiences
gained across the curriculum to develop their <strong>Design Quotient</strong>—the
ability to apply creativity, analytical skills, and critical thinking at
an advanced level.</p>
<p>They embark on their <strong>final year project</strong>, which challenges
them to work largely independently while receiving close guidance from
teachers. This stage sharpens not only their technical skills but also
their <strong>21CC dispositions</strong>—resilience, problem-solving, and
innovation—preparing them for future studies and the world beyond school.</p>
