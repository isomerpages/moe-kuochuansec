<td rowspan="1" colspan="1">
<p>The Secondary 2 and 4 History students were tasked to create a video using
research findings gathered from their History lessons.
<br>
<br>The Secondary 2s focussed on the Historical Investigation (HI) and created
a video based on their understanding about the legacy of the Founding Fathers
they have chosen to study while the Secondary 4s worked on the reasons
for the Cold War.
<br>
<br>Using iMovie, Windows Movie Maker and other video-making web applications,
this project encourages an engaging pedagogy to make learning fun and exciting.
Through their decision-making processes, in terms of the creation of their
own messages and the mode of portrayal in their clips, this project promotes
a deeper awareness of how history can come alive how they are able to evaluate
significance in the past and how they impact the present and even the future.</p>
