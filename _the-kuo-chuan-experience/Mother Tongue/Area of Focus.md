## Area of Focus

The Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School Mother Tongue (MT) Department aims to enthuse and develop students to become active learners and proficient MTL users so that they are able to use MTL to engage in effective communications in real life settings. 

  

Through the learning of MTL, the department also seeks to cultivate in students an appreciation of the cultural values and traditions associated with each MTL in our society.
