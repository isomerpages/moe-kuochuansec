<h4>A. Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)</h4>
<p>KCPSS has provided a SBB curriculum structure with the Secondary 1 cohort
since 2023.</p>
<p>Each form class will comprise students of diverse academic. They will
interact with peers with diverse perspectives, different strengths and
interests, build communication, collaboration and cross-cultural skills.</p>
<p>Art, Design and Technology, Food and Consumer Education, Music and Physical
Education, will be taught as common curriculum subjects in the form class,
where students will be assessed through a common standard. Teachers will
differentiate their teaching using a range of teaching approaches to ensure
a high level of teaching and learning in the classroom.</p>
<p>For English, Mathematics, Science, Mother Tongue and the Humanities, students
will learn these subjects in their respective assigned academic course.</p>
<p><strong>Subject-Based Banding (SBB)</strong>
</p>
<p>Subject-based banding (SBB) is one of many opportunities for students
to nurture their aptitudes and develop their strengths. SBB allows your
child/ ward to take specific subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary
1, if found suitable to do so.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>Eligibility to offer subjects at a more demanding level under SBB</strong>
</p>
<p>Students posted under Posting Group 2 and Posting Group1 can offer English
Language, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Languages at a more demanding
level from the start of Secondary 1, if they have performed well in these
subjects at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).</p>
<p>Students from posting groups 2 and 1 are eligible to take (English Language,
Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Language) at a more demanding level
from the start of Secondary 1, if they have performed well in these subjects
at the PSLE.</p>
