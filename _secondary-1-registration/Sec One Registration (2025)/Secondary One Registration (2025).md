<h2>Secondary One Registration (2025)</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome Message from the Principal</strong>
</p>
<p>Dear newly-posted students and parents,</p>
<p>Welcome to KCPSS! We are deeply honoured to have you join us as part of
our #TeamKCP community, and are certain that your time with us will be
one of purpose, growth and impact.</p>
<p>As you embark on your KCPSS journey, there will be time for us to connect
and to grow in confidence in our learning and exploration. For now, focus
on preparing your heart, mind and spirit for the new year. Secondary school
will bring with it new routines, relationships and perspectives on the
world that requires you to be open-minded and curious. Yet, at the same
time, know that KCPSS will be a place where you can look forward to the
future with hope, just as God told us in Jeremiah 29:11.</p>
<p>“For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper
you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”</p>
<p>I look forward to meeting you soon, and welcoming you to KCPSS. For now,
you will find on this website and various messages sent to you all the
key information that you need. In the event that you need further assistance,
please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
<p>May God bless you in this season of Christmas and as the New Year approaches.
See you soon!</p>
<p><strong>Mr Justin Tan</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Principal, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School</strong>
