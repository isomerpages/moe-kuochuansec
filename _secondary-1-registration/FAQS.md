**D: Full Subject Based Banding**  

**_9._**  **_How will Full SBB affect my child’s post-sec pathways?_**

Students will continue to take the GCE O- and N-Level examinations, as the new Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) Examination will only be implemented for the 2024 Sec 1 cohort and beyond.

  

Admissions to Post-Secondary Education Institutions (PSEIs) currently already recognise the efforts of students who take relevant subjects at a more demanding level. This will continue for all students who take subjects at a more demanding level, including students in schools who have implemented Full SBB.

  

The post-secondary admissions framework is being reviewed to take into consideration the changes resulting from Full SBB.  More details on changes to post-secondary admissions and pathways will be made available when the review is completed. 

**_10. Are students in schools implementing Full SBB allowed to opt-out of various aspects of Full SBB (e.g. from the mixed form classes)?_**

To allow all students to benefit from learning and interacting with one another in a mixed form class, students will not have the option to opt out of mixed form classes.   

  

**_11._** **_How can the school ensure that students from different courses and backgrounds will be able to socialise well and accept one another?_**

The school will strengthen our caring and supportive culture from the start of the school year to build bonds between the students and the teachers.

Opportunities for authentic interaction among students, such as weekly form teacher interaction with students and cohort activities e.g. cohort camp, inter-class games, will be created to widen their social circle and forge new friendships, and peer student leaders will also be appointed to look out for their classmates. 

  

**E: Subject Based Banding**  

**_12._** **_What if my child/ward did not obtain AL5 for the subject, can I appeal for SBB?_**  

For students who did not meet the eligibility criteria for SBB at the start of Secondary One, they can still be considered for SBB if they do well in their learning in Secondary One. These students will join SBB at the end of Secondary One Term 2 or Secondary One Term 4 as the mid-year or end-year SBB inserts

**_13._** **_If my child/ward cannot cope, can he/she drop the SBB subject?_**  


Students (with their parents/guardians’ consent) can make the final decision to continue or drop any SBB subject(s). However, students are strongly encouraged to give themselves ample time to adjust to the demands of the higher-level subject(s) before making any decision to drop. Parents/guardian should speak to their child/ward’s Subject Teachers, Form Teacher, Year Head, and/or School Leaders to find out more about their child/ward’s academic progress and potential before allowing them to drop any SBB subject.  

  

**14. What is the benefit of students taking SBB in NA or NT course?** 

SBB allows students to build a stronger foundation in subjects that they are good at, nurture their strengths and give them more opportunities throughout their educational journey, so that they are more engaged in learning.

If the student continues to thrive in the subject and takes it at the O’level at the end of Sec 4, they may be used in the computation of the aggregate to be considered for Direct-Entry Scheme to Polytechnic Programme (DPP) and Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP) eligibility.

  

**F: School Support Structure** 

**_15. Who can I contact regarding support for students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) or counselling?_**

For support related to SEN, you may contact our AED/LBS, Ms Angelia Ng at ng\_sian\_erh\_angelia@schools.gov.sg 

For support related to counselling, you may contact our School Counsellor, Mr Joey Hong at joey\_hong@schools.gov.sg

**_17\. Will my child/ward be issued with a new School Smart Card when term starts?_**

Please be informed that all students entering Secondary One in Jan 2023 will be issued with a new Secondary level School Smart Card (SSC).  While Secondary One Students are waiting for their Secondary level SSCs to be ready,  they can continue to use their Primary level SSCs for concessionary travel till end Apr 2023. Students can still purchase the Bus Concession Pass (BCP) using their Primary level SSCs, but they would need to purchase the BCP for Secondary School students.
