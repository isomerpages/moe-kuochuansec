**_10.  What if my child /ward did not obtained AL5 for the subject, can I appeal for SBB?_**  

For students who did not meet the eligibility criteria for SBB at the start of Secondary One, they can still be considered for SBB if they do well in their learning in Secondary One. These students will join SBB at the end of Secondary One Term 2 or Secondary One Term 4 as the mid-year or end-year SBB inserts  

  

**_11.  If my child/ward cannot cope, can he/she drop the SBB subject?_**

Students (with their parents/guardians’ consent) can make the final decision to continue or drop any SBB subject(s). However, students are strongly encouraged to give themselves ample time to adjust to the demands of the higher-level subject(s) before making any decision to drop. We will provide you and your child with support and guidance to fulfill their potential.

  

**_12.  What is the benefit of students taking SBB?_** 

SBB allows students to build a stronger foundation in subjects that they are good at, nurture their strengths and give them more opportunities throughout their educational journey, so that they are more engaged in learning.

If the student continues to thrive in the subject and takes it at the O-Levels, the results may be used in the computation of aggregate to be considered for DPP and PFP eligibility.
