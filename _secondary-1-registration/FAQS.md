onboarding process, if you had not done so when your child/ ward was in
primary school.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>6. Does my child/ ward need to register via e-registration or report in person if he/ she intends to appeal for a transfer to another school?</strong>
</p>
<p>If you intend to appeal for a transfer, please continue to submit your
e-registration via PG. You may subsequently approach the school of your
choice to request for a transfer.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>7. My child/ ward has been posted to KCPSS, but would like to request for school transfer due to medical reasons. What should I do?</strong>
</p>

must be accompanied by relevant supporting documents, such as medical reports,
letters from doctors. If you are unable to do so, you can submit your appeal
and documents via email at <em><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">kcpss@moe.edu.sg</a></em>.</p>

<p><strong><u>Full Subject-Based Banding</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>8.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>How will Full SBB affect my child’s post-sec pathways?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students will&nbsp; progress over 4/ 5 years of secondary education to
take the Secondary Education Certificate (SEC) Examination.</p>
<p>More details on the admissions to various post-secondary pathways can
be obtained from <a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/microsites/psle-fsbb/full-subject-based-banding/main.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">MOE’s website on FSBB</a>
<a href="#_msocom_1" class="msocomanchor" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">[1]</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>9. Are students allowed to opt out of various aspects of Full SBB (e.g., mixed form classes)?</strong>
</p>
<p>No.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>10.</strong>  <strong>How does the school ensure that students with diverse backgrounds socialise well and accept one another?</strong>
</p>
<p>There are opportunities for authentic interaction among students to help
them socialise and interact with one another.&nbsp; Teachers provide guidance
and support through weekly form teacher interaction with students and cohort
activities, e.g., orientation programmes, cohort camp, inter-class games.&nbsp;
These programmes and activities are designed to widen students’&nbsp; social
circle and create opportunities for them to forge new friendships.&nbsp;
Peer student leaders will also be appointed to support their classmates.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>11.</strong>  <strong>My child/ ward did not obtain AL5 for the subject.&nbsp; Can I appeal for him/ her to take the subject(s) at a more demanding level (MDL)?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who do not meet the eligibility criteria for subject(s) at MDL
at the start of Secondary One may still offer the subjects at a more demanding
level based on their performance at the end of Secondary 1 Semester 1,
at the end of Secondary 1 Semester 2, and at the end of Secondary 2 Semester
2.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>12.</strong>  <strong>If my child/ ward cannot cope with a subject at a more demanding level, can he/ she take the subject at a less demanding level?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to give themselves time to adjust to
the demands of the higher-level subject(s).&nbsp; Parents/ guardians should
speak to their child/ ward’s Subject Teachers, Form Teacher and Year Head
to find out more about their child/ ward’s progress and potential before
deciding on requesting for a change in level.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>13. What is the benefit of students taking subjects at a more demanding level?&nbsp; </strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subjects at the different levels allow students to build a stronger foundation
at a pace that is more suited to them.&nbsp; This allows students to nurture
their strengths, grow their interests and be more engaged in the learning
process.</p>
<p>If the student continues to thrive in the subject and takes a subject
at a MDL at the end of 4-5 years, the grades can be used (where relevant)
in the computation of the aggregate for their courses, e.g. Polytechnic
Foundation Programme (PFP).</p>
<p></p>

<p><strong>14. Who can I contact regarding support for students with Special Educational Needs (SEN) or counselling?</strong>

<p><strong>15. How can I apply for MOE Financial Assistance/ School-Based Financial Assistance?</strong>
</p>
<p>Submit an online application via Parents Gateway (Services &gt; Financial
Assistance). Submission of hardcopy and supporting documents are no longer
required.</p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>16. Will my child/ ward be issued with a new School Smart Card when term starts?</strong>
</p>
<p>All students entering Secondary One in Jan 2026 will be issued a new Secondary
level School Smart Card (SSC).&nbsp; While Secondary One Students are waiting
for their Secondary level SSCs to be ready, they can continue to use their
Primary level SSCs for concessionary travel till end Apr 2026. Students
can still purchase the Bus Concession Pass (BCP) using their Primary level
SSCs, but they will need to purchase the BCP for Secondary School students.</p>
