<p>There are opportunities for authentic interaction among students to help
them socialize and accept one another with guidance and support from their
teachers such as weekly form teacher interaction with students and cohort
activities e.g. orientation programmes, cohort camp, inter-class games.
These programmes and activities are designed to widen their social circle
and forge new friendships, and peer student leaders will also be appointed
to support their classmates.</p>
<h4>Subject-Based Banding</h4>
<p>12. My child/ ward did not obtain AL5 for the subject. Can I appeal for
him/ her to take the subject(s) at a more demanding level (MDL)?</p>
<p>Students who do not meet the eligibility criteria for subject(s) at MDL
at the start of Secondary One can still be considered at (i) the end of
Term 2 and (ii) Term 4 of Secondary One.</p>
<p>13. If my child/ ward cannot cope with a subject at a more demanding level,
can s/he take the subject at a less demanding level?</p>
<p>Students are strongly encouraged to give themselves time to adjust to
the demands of the higher-level subject(s). Parents/ guardian should speak
to their child/ ward’s Subject Teachers, Form Teacher and Year Head to
find out more about their child/ ward’s progress and potential before deciding
on requesting for a change in level.</p>
<p>14. What is the benefit of students taking subjects at a more demanding
level?</p>
<p>It allows students to build a stronger foundation in subjects at a pace
that is more suited for them. It nurtures their strengths, grows their
interests and they are more engaged in the learning process.</p>
<p>If the student continues to thrive in the subject and takes a subject
at a MDL at the end of 4/5 years, the grades can be used (where relevant)
in the computation of the aggregate for Direct-Entry Scheme to Polytechnic
Programme (DPP) and Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP).</p>
