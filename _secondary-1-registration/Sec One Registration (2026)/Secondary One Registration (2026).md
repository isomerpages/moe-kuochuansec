<h2>Secondary One Registration (2026)</h2>
<p><strong>Welcome Message from the Principal</strong>
</p>
<p>Dear students, parents and families,</p>
<p>It gives me great joy to welcome you to Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary
School! I am sure that you are excited about this new season in your schooling,
just as we are excited to welcome you to our #TeamKCP family.</p>
<p>As you prepare yourself mentally and spiritually for the coming year,
please do take some time to review the information available. There will
be a series of messages sent to you through Parents’ Gateway to guide you
through the process, and we are also available should you need assistance
with any individual needs or queries.</p>
<p>At KCPSS, we pride ourselves on being a School on a Hill — growing our
KCPians to shine their light in their learning, leadership and lives. As
in Matthew 5:14, this light cannot be hidden, and as every KCPian journeys
forth, they will make an impact on others as they serve and glorify our
Father in heaven.</p>
<p>Wishing you a blessed Christmas and a season filled with peace, joy and
hope. See you in the new year!</p>
