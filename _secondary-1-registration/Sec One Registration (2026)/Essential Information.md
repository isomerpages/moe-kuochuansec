<p>The following section provides essential information to help your child/
ward transit to secondary school.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A. Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)</strong>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every form class comprises students from diverse academic backgrounds.
Students will interact with peers with different perspectives, strengths
and interests, and be given opportunities to develop and deepen communication,
collaboration and cross-cultural skills.</p>
<p>Art, Design and Technology, Food and Consumer Education, Music and Physical
Education will be taught as common curriculum subjects in the form class,
where students will be assessed through a common standard. Teachers will
differentiate their teaching approaches in the classroom.</p>
<p>English, Mathematics, Science, Mother Tongue and the Humanities will be
taken at their respective assigned academic courses.</p>
<p><strong>Subject-Based Banding (SBB)</strong>
</p>
<p>Subject-based banding (SBB) is one of many opportunities for students
to nurture their aptitudes and develop their strengths. SBB allows your
child/ ward to take specific subjects at a more demanding level from Secondary
1, if eligible to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility to offer subjects at a more demanding level under SBB:</strong>
</p>
<p>Eligible students can offer English Language, Mother Tongue Languages,
Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary
1, based on their PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each of these subjects.</p>
