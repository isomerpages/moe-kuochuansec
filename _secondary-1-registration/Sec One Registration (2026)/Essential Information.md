and interests, and be given opportunities to develop and deepen communication,
collaboration and cross-cultural skills.</p>
<p>Art, Design and Technology, Food and Consumer Education, Music and Physical
Education will be taught as common curriculum subjects in the form class,
where students will be assessed through a common standard. Teachers will
differentiate their teaching approaches in the classroom.</p>

taken at their respective assigned academic courses.</p>
