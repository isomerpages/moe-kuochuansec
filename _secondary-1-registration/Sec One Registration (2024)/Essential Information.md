<p>For your convenience, we have collated all the essential matters that require your attention.

Full Subject-Based Banding (Full SBB)</h2><p>The Express, N(A) and N(T) streams will be removed.</p><p>MOE will post students to secondary school through three Posting Groups – Posting Groups 1, 2 and 3. The PSLE score ranges for the three Posting Groups will be mapped from the existing N (T), N (A) and Express streams respectively. Posting Groups will only be used for the purposes of admitting students into secondary school and to guide the initial subject levels students can offer at the start of Secondary One.</p><p>Once students enter secondary school, they will be grouped into mixed form classes comprising students from different Posting Groups and will have opportunities to interact and learn with peers of different backgrounds, strengths and interests. <br></p><p>For subjects such as Art, Design and Technology, Food and Consumer Education, Music and Physical Education, they will be taught as common curriculum subjects in the form class, where students will be assessed through a common standard regardless of their academic course. Teachers will differentiate their teaching to meet the needs of a class of students using a range of teaching approaches in maintaining a high level of quality and rigour in teaching and learning. </p><p>At the start of Secondary One, eligible students can offer English Language, Mother Tongue, Mathematics and Science at a more demanding level based on their PSLE Achievement Level (AL) for each of these subjects.</p><p></p><p><strong>Eligibility Criteria</strong></p><p>Students posted under Posting Group 2 and Posting Group1 can offer English Language, Mathematics, Science and Mother Tongue Languages at a more demanding level from the start of Secondary 1, if they have performed well in these subjects at the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).<br></p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Indicative Level of most Subjects Start of S1</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>PSLE Standard Grade</strong>&nbsp;</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>PSLE Foundation Grade</strong>&nbsp;</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Option to offer subject at</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>G2</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>AL 5 or better</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>-</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G3</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>G1</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>AL 5 or better</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>-</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G2 / G3</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>G1</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>AL 6</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>AL A</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>G2</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Offering subjects at a less demanding level</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>For students who offered English, Mathematics, and/or Science at Foundation level at PSLE, but are otherwise eligible to take most of their subjects at G3 when entering secondary school, they may choose to take these subjects at a less demanding level (I.e, G2) in consultation with their secondary schools.</p><p>Students who face exceptional difficulties coping with their Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) will have the option to offer G1 or G2 MTL.
