<h2>Appeals for transfer into KCPSS</h2>
<p>Students are centrally posted by MOE. If you wish to appeal, you may do
so via this <strong><a href="https://go.gov.sg/kcpss-s1-appeal" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">online form</a></strong>&nbsp;.
Applications are subject to available vacancies, and must meet the cut-off
point (COP) for the cohort. Only successful applicants will be notified.</p>
<p>Do note that you must register with the school that your child/ward has
been posted to, before you submit the transfer request.</p>
