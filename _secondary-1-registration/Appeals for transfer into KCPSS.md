## Appeals for transfer into KCPSS

Students are centrally posted by MOE. If you wish to appeal, you may do so via thisÂ **[online form](https://form.gov.sg/61a97e2521cd94001459fcc7)**. **<font size=4>(LINK DOES NOT WORK)</font>** Applications are subject to available vacancies, and must meet the cut-off point (COP) for the cohort. Only successful applicants will be notified.

  

Do note that you must register with the school that your child/ward has been posted to, before you submit the transfer request.
