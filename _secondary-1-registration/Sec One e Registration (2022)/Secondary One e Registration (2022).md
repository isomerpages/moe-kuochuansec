To forge a strong KCPian identity, the Orientation Student Leaders have specially designed an Orientation T-shirt for their Juniors. You may refer to the sizing guide found in **[this attachment](https://kuochuanpresbyteriansec.moe.edu.sg/qql/slot/u177/VirtualOpenHouse/S1Registration22/S1PLetter.pdf)** to place an order for your child/ward while you are completing the registration form. There are also some other details involving the Orientation programme e.g. dismissal time, things to bring, attire and payment instructions for T-shirts. Please note that the price of the T-Shirt is $7.
