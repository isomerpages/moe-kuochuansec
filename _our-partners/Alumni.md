## ALUMNI


### President's Message


Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Schools Alumni founded in 1992, after the Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School and Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School were formed with a **Mission** to provide former students with opportunities to interact and network, and the schools with support to be **_aflame for truth_** in the education of their students.  
  
Although newly organised as a primary and a secondary school, they were the successors to two much older schools - the Presbyterian Boys' School and the Kuo Chuan Girls's School. The Presbyterian Boys's School was in turn the successor to Dryburgh English School and Choon Guan English School.  
  
Whereas the two sister schools founded by the Presbyterian mission were separated by sex, now they are separated according to the level - primary or secondary.  
  
In the past there were the Presbyterian Old Boys' Association and the Kuo Chuan Old Girls' Association; the logical conclusion now was to have one Association catering to the old students of both schools.
